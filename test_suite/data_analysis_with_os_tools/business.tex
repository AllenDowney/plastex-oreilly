It's a relatively expensive weeklymagazine, and they offered me three different plans to renew mysubscription: one year (52 issues) for \$130, two years for \$220, orthree years for \$275.  Table \ref{tbl:subscriptions} summarizes theseoptions and also shows the respective cost per issue.\begin{table}[h]\def\vrl{\smash{\vrule height54pt  width.25pt depth4pt}}\tbl{Pricing plans for a magazine subscription\label{tbl:subscriptions}}{%\begin{tabular}{l@{\hskip9pt}c@{\hskip9pt}c@{\hskip9pt}c@{\hskip9pt}c}\toprule  \TCH{Subscription} && \TCH{Total price} && \TCH{Price per issue} \\\colrule  Single issue && n/a   && 6.00 \\  1 year       && 130 && 2.50 \\  2 years      && 220 && 2.12 \\  3 years      &\vrl& 275 &\vrl& 1.76 \\\botrule\end{tabular}}\end{table}Assuming that I want to continue the subscription, which of thesethree options makes the most sense? From Table \ref{tbl:subscriptions},we can see that each issue of the magazine becomes cheaper as I commitmyself to a longer subscription period, but is this a good deal?  Infact, what does it mean for a proposal like this to be a ``gooddeal''? Somehow, stomping up nearly three hundred dollars right nowseems like a stretch, even if I remind myself that it saves me morethan half the price on each issue.This little story demonstrates the central topic of this chapter: the\emph{time value of money}, which expresses the notion that a hundreddollars today are worth more than a hundred dollars a year from now.In this chapter,\vadjust{\pagebreak} I shall introduce some standard concepts andcalculational tools that are required whenever we need to make achoice between different investment decisions---whether they involveour own personal finances or the evaluation of business cases fordifferent corporate projects.I find the material in this chapter fascinating---not because it isrocket science (it isn't) but because it is so fundamental to how theeconomy works. Yet very few people, in particular, very few techpeople, have any understanding of it. (I certainly didn't.) This is ashame, not just because the topic is obviously important but alsobecause it is not really all that mystical. A little familiarity withthe basic concepts goes a long way toward removing most of theconfusion (and, let's face it, the intimidation) that many of usexperience when reading the Wall Street pages.More important in the context of this book is that a lot of dataanalysis is done specifically to evaluate different business proposalsand to support decisions among them. To be able to give effective,appropriate advice, you want to understand the concepts andterminology of this particular problem domain.% ============================================================\section{The Time Value of Money}\index{financial calculations!time value of money|(}\index{time value of money|(} Let's return to the subscription problem. The essential insight isthat---instead of paying for the second and third year of thesubscription \emph{now}---I could invest that money, reap theinvestment benefit, and pay for the subsequent years of thesubscription later. In other words, the discount offered by themagazine must be \emph{greater} than the investment income I canexpect if I were instead to invest the sum.    It is this ability to gain an investment benefit that makes havingmoney \emph{now} more valuable than having the same amount of money\emph{later}. Note well that this has nothing to do with the conceptof \emph{inflation}, which is the process by which a certain amount ofmoney tends to buy a lesser amount of goods as time passes. For ourpurposes, inflation is an external influence over which we have nocontrol. In contrast, investment and purchasing decisions (such as theearlier magazine subscription problem) are under our control, and timevalue of money calculations can help us make the best possibledecisions in this regard.\subsection{A Single Payment: Future and Present Value} \index{time value of money!future and present value}  \index{future value}\index{present value}  Things are easiest when there is only a single payment involved.Imagine we are given the following choice: receive \$1,000 today, orreceive \$1,050 a year from now. Which one should we choose?    Well, that depends on what we could do with \$1,000 right now.  Forthis kind of analysis, it is customary to assume that we\vadjust{\pagebreak} would putthe money in a ``totally safe form of investment'' and use the returnsgenerated\vadjust{} in this way as a benchmark for comparison.\footnote{This  used to mean investing in U.S.\ Treasury Bonds or the equivalent,  but at the time of this writing, even these are no longer considered  sacrosanct. But that's leaving the scope of this discussion!} Now wecan compare the alternatives against the interest that would begenerated by this ``safe'' investment. For example, assume that thecurrent interest rate that we could gain on a ``safe'' investment is 5percent annually. If we invest \$1,000 for a full year, then at theyear's end, we will receive back our principal (\$1,000) and, inaddition, the accrued interest ($0.05 \cdot \$1000 = \$50$), for atotal of \$1,050.    In this example, both options lead to the same amount of money afterone year; we say that they are \emph{equivalent}. In other words,receiving \$1,000 now is \emph{equivalent} to receiving \$1,050 a yearfrom now, \emph{given} that the current interest rate on a safe formof investment is 5 percent annually. Equivalence always refers to aspecific time frame and interest rate.    Clearly, any amount of money that we now possess has a \emph{future  value} (or \emph{future worth}) at any point in the future;likewise, a payment that we will receive at some point in the futurehas a \emph{present value} (or \emph{present worth}) now.  Both valuesdepend on the interest rate that we could achieve by investing in asafe alternative investment instead. The present or future values mustbe equivalent at equal times.%%% XXX is the last statement exactly right? #    There is a little bit of math behind this that is not complicated butis often a little messy. The future value $V_f$ of some base amount$M$ (the \emph{principal}), after a single time period during whichthe amount earns $p$ percent of interest, is calculated as follows:%\begin{align*}V_f & = M + \frac{p}{100} M \\    & = \paren{ 1 + \frac{p}{100} } M\end{align*}%The first term on the righthand side expresses that we get ourprincipal back, and the second term is the amount of interest wereceive in addition. Here and in what follows, I explicitly showthe denominator 100 that is used to translate a statement such as``$p$ percent'' into the equivalent numerical factor $p/100$.    Conversely, if we want to know how much a certain amount of money inthe future is worth today, then we have to \emph{discount} that amountto its present value. To find the present value, we work the precedingequation backward. The present value $V_p$ is unknown, but we do knowthe amount of money $M$ that we will have at some point in the future,hence the equation becomes:%\[M = \paren{ 1 + \frac{p}{100} } V_p\]%    This can be solved for $V_p$:%\[V_p = \frac{M}{1+\frac{p}{100}}\]%   Note how we find the future or present value by multiplying the baseamount by an appropriate \emph{equivalencing factor}---namely, thefuture-worth factor $1+p/100$ and the present-worth factor$1/(1+p/100)$. Because most such calculations involve discounting afuture payment to the present value, the percentage rate $p$ used inthese formulas is usually referred to as the \emph{discount rate}.    This example was the simplest possible because there was only a singlepayment involved---either at the beginning or at the end of the periodunder consideration. Next, we look at scenarios where there aremultiple payments occurring over time.\subsection{Multiple Payments: Compounding}\index{time value of money!compounding|(}\index{compounding|(}    Matters become a bit more complicated when there is not just a singlepayment involved as in the example above but a series of paymentsover time. Each of these payments must be discounted by theappropriate time-dependent factor, which leads us to \emph{cash-flow  analysis}. \index{cash-flow analysis} In addition, payments made or received may alter thebase amount on which we operate, this leads to the concept of\emph{compounding}.Let's consider compounding first, since it is so fundamental. Again,the idea is simple: if we put a sum of money into an interest-bearinginvestment and then \emph{reinvest} the generated interest, we willstart to receive interest on the interest itself. In other words, wewill start receiving \emph{compound interest}.Here is how it works: we start with principal $M$ and invest itat interest rate $p$. After one year, we have:%\[V(1) = \left( 1 + \frac{p}{100} \right) M\]%  In the second year, we receive interest on the combined sum of theprincipal and the interest from the first year:%\begin{align*}V(2) & = \left( 1 + \frac{p}{100} \right) V(1) \\     & = \left( 1 + \frac{p}{100} \right)^2 M\end{align*}%and so on. After $n$ years, we will have:%\[V(n) = \left( 1 + \frac{p}{100} \right)^n M\]%    These equations tell us the future worth of our investment at anypoint in time. It works the other way around, too: we can determinethe present value of a payment that we expect to receive $n$ yearsfrom now by working the equations backward (much as we did previouslyfor a single payment) and find:%\[V(\text{present}) = \frac{M}{ \left( 1+\frac{p}{100} \right)^n }\]%    We can see from these equations that, if we continue to reinvest ourearnings, then the total amount of money grows exponentially with time(\ie, as $a^t$ for some constant $a$)---in other words,\emph{fast}. The growth law that applies to compound interest is thesame that describes the growth of bacteria cultures or similarsystems, where at each time step new members are added to thepopulation \emph{and} start producing offspring themselves. In suchsystems, not only does the population grow, but the rate at which itgrows is constantly increasing as well.    On the other hand, suppose you take out a loan without making paymentsand let the lender add the accruing interest back onto your principal.In this case, you not only get deeper into debt every month, but youdo so at a faster rate as time goes by.\subsection{Calculational Tricks with Compounding}    Here is a simple trick that is quite convenient when makingapproximate calculations of~future and present worth. Thesingle-payment formula for future worth, $V = (1+p/100) M$, is simpleand intuitive: the principal \emph{plus} the interest after oneperiod. In contrast, the corresponding formula for present worth $V =\frac{M}{1+p/100}$, seems to make less intuitive sense and is harderto work with (how much is \$1,000 divided by 1.05?). But this is againone of those situations where guesstimation techniques (see Chapter\ref{ch:guesstimation}; also see Appendix \ref{app:calculus}) can bebrought to bear. We can approximate the discounting factor as follows:%\[\frac{1}{1+\frac{p}{100}}   \approx 1 - \frac{p}{100} + \left( \frac{p}{100} \right)^2 \mp \dotsb\]%    Since $p$ is typically small (single digits), it follows that $p/100$is very small, and so we can terminate the expansion after the firstterm. Using this approximation, the discounting equation for thepresent worth becomes $V = ( 1 - p/100 ) M$, which has an intuitiveinterpretation: the present value is equal to the future value, lessthe interest that we will have received by then.    We can use similar formulas even in the case of compounding, since:%\begin{gather*}\left( 1 + \frac{p}{100} \right)^n \approx 1 + n \frac{p}{100} + \dotsb \\\left( 1 + \frac{p}{100} \right)^{-n} \approx 1 - n \frac{p}{100} + \dotsb \end{gather*}%However, keep in mind that the overall perturbation must be small forthe approximation to be valid. In particular, as the number of years$n$ grows, the perturbation term $n p/100$ may no longer be small.Still, even for 5 percent over 5 years, the approximation gives $1 \pm25/100 = 1.25$ or 0.75, respectively. Compare this with the exactvalues of 1.28 and 0.79.  However, for 10 percent over 10 years, theapproximation starts to break down, yielding 2 and 0, respectively,compared to the exact values of 2.59 and 0.39.    Similar logic is behind ``Einstein's Rule of 72.'' This rule of thumbstates that if you divide 72 by the applicable interest rate, youobtain the number of years it would take for your investment todouble.  So if you earn 7 percent interest, your money will double in10 years, but if you only earn 3.5 percent, it will take 20 years todouble.    What's the basis for this rule? By now, you can probably figure it outyourself, but here is the solution in a nutshell: for your investmentto double, the compounding factor must equal 2. Therefore, we need tosolve $(1 + p/100)^n = 2$ for $n$. Applying logarithms on both sideswe find $n = \log(2)/\log(1+p/100)$. In a second step, we expand thelogarithm in the denominator (remember that $p/100$ is a smallperturbation!) and end up with $n = \log(2) \cdot (100/p) = 69/p$,since the value of $\log(2)$ is approximately 0.69. The number 69 isawkward to work with, so it is usually replaced by the number72---which has the advantage of being evenly divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6,8, and 9 (you can replace 72 with 70 for interest rates of 5 or 7percent).    Here is another calculational tool that you may find useful.  Strictlyspeaking, an expression such as $x^n$ is defined only for integer$n$. For general exponents, the power function is defined as $x^n =\exp(n \log x)$. We can use this when calculating compounding factorsas follows:%\begin{align*}\paren{ 1 + \frac{p}{100} }^n   & = \exp \paren{ n \log \paren{1 + p/100} } \\  & \approx e^{n p/100}\end{align*}%    where in the second step we have expanded the logarithm again andtruncated the expansion after the first term. This form of thecompounding factor is often convenient (\eg, it allows us to usearbitrary values for the time period $n$, not just full years). Itbecomes exact in the limit of continuous compounding (discussedshortly).    Interest rates are conventionally quoted ``per year,'' as in ``5percent annually.'' But payments may occur more frequently than that.Savings accounts, for example, pay out any accrued interest on amonthly basis. That means that (as long as we don't withdraw anything)the amount of money that earns us interest grows every month; we sayit is \emph{compounded monthly}. (This is in contrast to otherinvestments, which pay out interest or dividends only on a quarterlyor even annual basis.) To take advantage of the additionalcompounding, it is of course in our interest (pun intended) to receivepayments as early as possible.  This monthly compounding is the reason for the difference between the\emph{nominal} interest rate and the annual \emph{yield} that you willfind stated on your bank's website: the nominal interest rate is therate $p$ that is used to determine the amount of interest paidout to you each month. The yield tells you by how much your money willgrow over the course of the year when the monthly compounding hasbeen factored in. With our knowledge, we can now calculate the yieldfrom the nominal rate:%\[\left( 1 + \frac{p_{{\rm yield}}}{100} \right)  = \left( 1 + \frac{ \frac{p_{{\rm nominal}}}{12}}{100} \right)^{12} \]%One more bit of terminology: the interest rate $p/12$ that is used todetermine the value of the monthly payout is known as the\emph{effective} interest rate.    Of course, other payment periods are possible. Many mutual funds payout quarterly. In contrast, many credit cards compound daily.  Intheory, we can imagine payments being made constantly (but at anappropriately reduced effective interest rate); this is the case of\emph{continuous compounding} mentioned earlier. In this case, thecompounding factor is given by the exponential function.(Mathematically, you replace the 12 in the last formula by $n$ andthen let $n$ go to infinity, using the identity $\lim_{n \to \infty}(1 + x/n)^n = \exp(x)$.)\index{time value of money!compounding|)}\index{compounding|)}\subsection{The Whole Picture: Cash-Flow Analysis and Net Present Value}\index{time value of money!cash-flow analysis and net present value|(}\index{cash-flow analysis|(}\index{NPV (net present value)|(} \index{net present value NPV)|(}  We now have all the tools at our disposal to evaluate the financialimplications of any investment decision, no matter how complicated.Imagine we are running a manufacturing plant (or perhaps an operationlike Amazon's, where books and other goods are put into boxes andmailed to customers---that's how \emph{I} learned about all thesethings). We may consider buying some piece of automated equipment forsome part of the process (\eg, a sorting machine that sorts boxes ontodifferent trucks according to their destination).  Alternatively, wecan have people do the same job manually.  Which of these twoalternatives is better from an economic point of view?    The manual solution has a simple structure: we just have to pay outthe required wages every year. If we decide to buy the machine, thenwe have to pay the purchase price now (this is also known as the\emph{first cost}) and also pay a small maintenance fee each year. Forthe sake of the argument, assume also that we expect to use themachine for ten years and then sell it on for scrap value.    In economics texts, you will often find the sequence of paymentsvisualized using \emph{cash-flow diagrams} (see Figure\ref{fig:cashflow}). Time progresses from left to right; inflows areindicated by upward-pointing arrows and outflows by downward-pointingarrows.% omitting revenue : assumed the same for both solutions \begin{figure}  \centerline{\includegraphics{img/cashflow}}  \caption{Examples of cash-flow diagrams. Arrows pointing up    correspond to money received; arrows pointing down, to money    spent.}  \label{fig:cashflow}\end{figure}    To decide between different alternatives, we now proceed as follows:\begin{enumerate}\item Determine all individual net cash flows (\emph{net} cash flows,   because we offset annual costs against revenues).\item Discount each cash flow to its present value.\item Add up all contributions.\end{enumerate} The quantity obtained in the last step is known either as the\emph{net present value} (NPV) or the \emph{discounted net cash flow}:it is the total value of all cash flows, each properly discounted toits present value. In other words, our financial situation will be thesame, whether we execute the entire series of cash flows \emph{or}receive the net present value today.  Because the net present valuecontains all inflows and outflows (properly discounted to the presentvalue), it is a comprehensive single measure that can be used tocompare the financial outcomes of different investment strategies.We can express the net present value of a series of cash flows in asingle formula:%\[\text{NPV} = \sum_i \frac{c(i)}{(1+p/100)^i}\]%where $c(i)$ is the net cash flow at payment period $i$ and$1/(1+p/100)^i$ is the associated discounting factor.% --- XXX : is this at all clear?There is one more concept that is interesting in this context. Whatshould we use for the discount rate $p$ in the second step above?Instead of supplying a value, we can ask how much interest we wouldhave to receive elsewhere (on a ``safe'' investment) to obtain thesame (or higher) payoff than that expected from the planned project.Let's consider an example. Assume we are evaluating a project thatwould require us to purchase some piece of equipment at the beginningbut that would then result in a series of positive cash flows over thenext so many years.  Is this a ``good'' investment? It is if its netpresent value is positive! (That's pretty much the definition of ``netpresent value'': the NPV takes into account the first cost to purchasethe equipment as well as the subsequent positive cash flows. If thediscounted cash flows are greater than the first cost, we come outahead.) But the net present value depends on the discount rate $p$, sowe need to find that value of $p$ for which the NPV first becomeszero: if we can earn a higher interest rate elsewhere, then theproject does not make financial sense and we should instead take ourmoney to the bank. But if the bank would pay us less than the\emph{rate of return} just calculated, then the project is financiallythe better option. (To find a numeric value for the rate of return,plug your cash flow structure $c(i)$ into the equation for NPV andthen solve for $p$. Unless the cash flows are particularly simple, youwill have to do this numerically.)The net present value is such an important criterion when makinginvestment decisions because it provides us with a single number thatsummarizes the financial results of any planned project. It gives usan objective (financial) quantity to decide among different investmentalternatives.    Up to a point, that is. The process described here is only as good asits inputs. In particular, we have assumed that we know all inputsperfectly---possibly for many years into the future.  Of course wedon't have perfect knowledge, and so we better accommodate for thatuncertainty somehow. That will be the topic of the next section.    There is another, more subtle problem when evaluating differentoptions solely based on net present value: different investmentalternatives may have nonfinancial benefits or drawbacks that are notcaptured by the net present value.  For example, using manual labormay lead to greater flexibility: if business grows more strongly thanexpected, then the company can hire additional workers, and ifbusiness slows down, then it can reduce the number of workers. Incontrast, any piece of equipment has a maximum capacity, which may bea limiting factor if business grows more strongly than expected. Thedistinction arising here is that between fixed and variable cost, andwe will come back to it toward the end of the chapter.\index{time value of money!cash-flow analysis and net present value|)}\index{cash-flow analysis|)}\index{NPV (net present value)|)} \index{net present value NPV)|)} \index{financial calculations!time value of money|)}\index{time value of money|)}\vspace*{-9pt}% ============================================================\section{Uncertainty in Planning and Opportunity Costs}\index{financial calculations!uncertainty and opportunity costs|(} \index{uncertainty in planning|(}     Now we are ready to revisit the magazine subscription problem from thebeginning of this chapter. Let's consider only two alternatives:paying the entire amount for a two-year subscription up front ormaking two single-year payments. The NPV for the second option is$\left( 1 + 1/(1+p/100) \right) C_{{\rm 1yr}}$, where we have leftthe discount rate $p$ undetermined for the moment. We can now ask:what interest rate would we have to earn elsewhere to make the secondoption worthwhile? In other words, we want to know the discount ratewe'd have to apply to make the NPV of the multiple-payment optionequal to the cost of the single-payment plan:%\[\left( 1 + \frac{1}{1+\frac{p}{100}} \right) C_{{\rm 1yr}} = C_{{\rm 2yr}}\]%    This equation can be solved for $p$. The result is $p = 30$ percent!In other words, the two-year subscription is so much cheaper that wewould have to find an investment yielding 30 percent annually beforeit would be worthwhile to pay for the subscription year by year andinvest the saved money elsewhere. No investment (and certainly no``safe'' investment) yields anywhere near that much. Clearly,something is amiss. (Exercise for the reader: find the net presentvalue for the three-year subscription and verify that it leads to thesame value for $p$.)\vspace*{-6pt}\subsection{Using Expectation Values to Account for Uncertainty}\index{expectation values!accounting for uncertainty} The two- and three-year plans carry a hidden cost for us: once we havesigned up, we can no longer freely\vadjust{\pagebreak} decide over our money---we'recommitted ourselves for the long haul. In contrast, if we pay on ayearly basis, then we can reevaluate every year whether we want tocontinue the subscription.  The price for this freedom is a highersubscription fee. However, we will probably not find it easy todetermine the exact dollar value that this freedom is worth to us.    From the magazine's perspective, the situation is simpler. They cansimply ask how much money they expect to make from an individualsubscriber under either option. If I sign up for the two-yearsubscription, they make $C_{{\rm 2yr}}$ with certainty; if I sign upfor the one-year subscription, they make $C_{{\rm 1yr}}$ withcertainty now and another $C_{{\rm 1yr}}$ later---\emph{provided} Irenew my subscription! In this case, then, the amount of money themagazine expects to make on me is $C_{{\rm 1yr}} + \gammaC_{{\rm 1yr}}$, where $\gamma$ is the probability that I will renewthe subscription. From the magazine's perspective, both options mustbe equally favorable (otherwise they would adjust the price of thetwo-year subscription to make them equal), so we can equate theexpected revenues and solve for $\gamma$. The result comes out toabout $\gamma = 0.7$---in other words, the magazine expects (based onpast experience, and so on) that about 70 percent of its currentsubscribers will renew their subscription. For three years, theequation becomes $( 1 + \gamma + \gamma^2) C_{{\rm 1yr}} =C_{{\rm 3yr}}$ because, to sign up for three years, a subscriber mustdecide \emph{twice} to renew the subscription. If you work through thealgebra, you will find that $\gamma$ again comes out to about $\gamma= 0.7$, providing a nice consistency check.There are two takeaways in this example that are worth emphasizing:the first concerns making economic decisions that are subject touncertainty. The second is the concept of opportunity cost, which isthe topic of the following section.When making economic decisions that are subject to uncertainty, youmay want to take this uncertainty into account by replacing theabsolute cash flows with their expected values. A simple probabilitymodel for the likely payout is often sufficient.  In the magazineexample there were just two outcomes: the subscriber renews withprobability $\gamma = 0.7$ and value $C_{{\rm 1yr}}$, or thesubscriber does not renew with probability $\gamma = 0.3$ and value$0$, hence the expected value is $0.3 \cdot 0 + 0.7 \cdotC_{{\rm 1yr}}$. If your situation warrants it and if you can specifythe probability distribution for various payout alternatives in moredetail, then you can calculate the expected value accordingly. (SeeChapter \ref{ch:scaling} and Chapter \ref{ch:probability} for moreinformation on how to build models to support this kind ofconclusion.)% Below: do I need to be more explicity on the simulation topic?    Working with expectation values is convenient, because once you havedetermined the expected value of the payout, you no longer need toworry about the probabilities for the various outcomes: they have beenentirely absorbed into the expectation values. What you lose isinsight into the probable spread of outcomes. For a quickorder-of-magnitude check, that's acceptable, but for a more seriousstudy, an estimate of the spread should be included.  There are twoways to do this: repeat your calculation multiple times usingdifferent values (low, medium, high) for the expected payouts at everystep to develop a sense for the range of possible outcomes. (If thereare many different options, you may want to do this throughsimulation; see\vadjust{\pagebreak} Chapter \ref{ch:simulation}.) Alternatively, you canevaluate both the expectation value and the spread directly from theprobability distribution to obtain a range for each estimated value:$\mu \pm \sigma$.  Now you can use this sum in your calculations,treating $\sigma$ as a small perturbation and evaluate the effect ofthis perturbation on your model (see Chapter \ref{ch:guesstimation}).\index{uncertainty in planning|)}\vspace*{-6pt}\subsection{Opportunity Costs}\index{opportunity costs}\index{costs!opportunity costs}   The second point that I would like to emphasize is the concept of\emph{opportunity cost}. Opportunity costs arise when we miss out onsome income (the ``opportunity'') because we were not in a position totake advantage of it. Opportunity costs formalize the notion thatresources are finite and that, if we apply them to one purpose, thenthose resources are not available for other uses. In particular, if wecommit resources to a project, then we want that project to generate abenefit greater than the opportunity costs that arise, because thoseresources are no longer available for other uses.    I find it easiest to think about opportunity cost in the context ofcertain business situations.  For instance, suppose a company takes ona project that pays \$15,000.  While this contract is under way,someone else offers the company a project that would pay\$20,000. Assuming that the company cannot break its initialengagement, it is now incurring an opportunity cost of \$5,000.    I find the \emph{concept} of opportunity cost useful as a way to put aprice on alternatives, particularly when no money changes hands. Intextbooks, this is often demonstrated by the example of the studentwho takes a trip around the world instead of working at a summer job.Not only does the student have to pay the actual expenses for thetrip but also incurs an opportunity cost equal to the amount offorgone wages. The concept of opportunity cost allows us to accountfor these forgone wages, which would otherwise be difficult becausethey do not show up on any account statement (since they were neveractually paid).On the other hand, I often find opportunity cost a somewhat shadowyconcept because it totally hinges on a competing opportunity actuallyarising. Imagine you try to decide between two opportunities: an offerfor a project that would pay \$15,000 and the prospect of a projectpaying \$20,000.  If you take the first job and then the secondopportunity comes through as well, you are incurring an opportunitycost of \$5,000. But if the second project falls through, youropportunity cost just dropped to zero! (The rational way to make thisdecision would be to calculate the total revenue expected from eachprospect but \emph{weighted by the probability} that the contract willactually be signed. This brings us back to calculations involving\emph{expected} payouts, as discussed in the preceding section.)    To be clear: the concept of opportunity cost has nothing to do withuncertainty in planning. It is merely a way to evaluate the relativecosts of competing opportunities. However, when evaluating competingdeals, we must often decide between plans that have a differentlikelihood of coming to fruition, and therefore opportunity cost andplanning for uncertainty often arise together.\index{financial calculations!uncertainty and opportunity costs|)} % ============================================================\section{Cost Concepts and Depreciation}\index{financial calculations!cost concepts and depreciation|(} \index{costs!cost concepts and depreciation|(}    The methods described in the previous sections might suggest that thenet present value is all there is to financial considerations.  Thisis not so---other factors may influence our decision. Some factors areentirely outside the financial realm (\eg, ethical or strategicconsiderations); others might have direct business implications butare not sufficiently captured by the quantities we have discussed sofar.For example, let's go back to the situation discussed earlier where weconsidered the choice between two alternatives: buying a sortingmachine or having the same task performed manually.  Once we identifyall arising costs and discount them properly to their present value,it would seem we have accounted for all financial implications.  Butthat would be wrong: the solution employing manual labor is moreflexible, for instance. If the pace of the business varies over thecourse of the year, then we need to buy a sorting machine that islarge enough to handle the busiest season---which means it will beunderutilized during the rest of the year. If we rely on manual labor,then we can more flexibly scale capacity up through temporary labor orovertime---and we can likewise respond to unexpectedly strong (orweak) growth of the overall business more flexibly, again by adjustingthe number of workers. (This practice may have furtherconsequences---for example, regarding labor relations.) In short, weneed to look at the costs, and how they arise, in more detail.To understand the cost structure of a business or an operation better,it is often useful to discuss it in terms of three pairs ofcomplementary concepts:\begin{enumerate}\item Direct versus indirect cost\item Fixed versus variable cost\item Capital expenditure versus operating cost\end{enumerate}For good measure, I'll also throw in the concept of\emph{depreciation}, although it is not a cost in the strict sense ofthe word.\subsection{Direct and Indirect Costs}\index{direct costs}\index{indirect costs}  Labor and materials that are applied in creating the \emph{product}(\ie, in the creation of something the company will \emph{sell}) areconsidered direct labor or direct materials cost.  Indirect costs, onthe other hand, arise from activities that the company undertakesto maintain \emph{itself}: management, maintenance, and administrativetasks (payroll and accounting) but also training, for example. Anotherterm for such indirect costs is \emph{overhead}.I should point out that this is a slightly different definition ofdirect and indirect costs than the one you will find in theliterature. Most textbooks define direct cost as the cost that is``easily attributable'' to the production process, whereas indirectcost is ``not easily attributable.'' This definition makes\vadjust{\pagebreak} it seem asif the distinction between direct and indirect costs is mostly one ofconvenience. Furthermore, the textbook definition provides no reasonwhy, for example, maintenance and repair activities are usuallyconsidered indirect costs. Surely, we can keep track of which machineneeded how much repair and therefore assign the associated cost to theproduct made on that specific machine. On the other hand, by mydefinition, it is clear that maintenance should be considered anindirect cost because it is an activity the company undertakes to keep\emph{itself} in good order---not to generate value for the customer.I have used the term ``product'' for whatever the company is selling.For manufacturing or retail industries this is a straightforwardconcept, but for a service industry the ``product'' may be intangible.Nevertheless, in probably all businesses we can introduce the conceptof a single produced unit or \emph{unit of production}. Inmanufacturing and retail there are actual ``units,'' but in otherindustries the notion of a produced unit is a bit more artificial: inservice industries, for instance, one often uses ``billable hours'' asa measure of production.  Other industries have specializedconventions: the airline industry uses ``passenger miles,'' forexample.The unit is an important concept because it is the basis for the mostcommon measure of productivity---namely the unit cost or \emph{cost  per unit} (CPU). \index{CPU (cost per unit)} The cost per unit is obtained by dividing thetotal (dollar) amount spent during a time period (per month, forinstance) by the total number of units produced during that time. Ifwe include not only the direct cost but also the indirect cost in thiscalculation, we obtain what is called the \emph{loaded} or\emph{burdened} cost per unit.We can go further and break out the various contributions to the unitcost. For example, if there are multiple production steps, then we candetermine how much each step contributes to the total cost. We canalso study how much indirect costs contribute to the overall cost aswell as how material costs relate to labor. Understanding thedifferent contributions to the total cost per unit is often aworthwhile exercise because it points directly to where the money isspent. And appearances can be deceiving. I have seen situations whereliterally hundreds of people were required for a certain processingstep whereas, next door, a single person was sufficient to oversee acomparable but highly automated process. Yet once you calculated thecost per unit, it all looked very different: because the number ofunits going through the automated process was low, its total cost perunit was actually higher than for the manual process. And because somany units where processed manually, their labor cost \emph{per unit}turned out to be very low.In general, it is desirable to have low overhead relative to thedirect cost: a business should spend relatively less time and money onmanaging itself than on generating value for the customer. In thisway, the ratio of direct to indirect cost can be a telling indicatorfor ``top-heavy'' organizations that seem mostly occupied withmanaging themselves. On the other hand, overeager attempts to improvethe direct/indirect cost ratio can lead to pretty unsanitarymanipulations. For example, imagine a company that considers softwareengineers \emph{direct} labor, while\vadjust{\pagebreak} any form of management (teamleads and project managers) is considered \emph{indirect}. The naturalconsequence is that management responsibilities are pushed ontodevelopers to avoid ``indirect'' labor. Of course, this does not makethese tasks go away; they just become invisible. (It also leads to theinefficient use of a scarce resource: developers are always in shortsupply---and they are expensive.)  In short, beware the danger ofperverted incentives!\subsection{Fixed and Variable Costs}\index{fixed costs}\index{variable costs}  Compared to the previous distinction (between direct and indirectcosts), the distinction between fixed and variable costs is clearer. The\emph{variable} costs are those that change in response to changingdemand, while \emph{fixed} costs don't. For a car manufacturer, thecost of steel is a variable cost: if fewer cars are being built, lesssteel is consumed. Whether labor costs are fixed or variable dependson the type of labor and the employment contracts.  But the capitalcost for the machines in the production line is a fixed cost, becauseit has to be paid regardless of whether the machines are busy or idle.It is important not to confuse direct and variable costs.  Althoughdirect costs are more likely to be variable (and overhead, in general,is fixed), these are unrelated concepts; one can easily find examplesof fixed, yet direct costs. For example, consider a consultancy withsalaried employees: their staff of consultants is a \emph{direct}cost, yet it is also a \emph{fixed} cost because the consultantsexpect their wages regardless of whether the consultancy has projectsfor them or not. (We'll see another example in a moment.)In general, having high fixed costs relative to variable ones makes abusiness or industry less flexible and more susceptible to downturns.An extreme example is the airline industry: its cost structure isalmost exclusively fixed (pretty much the only variable cost is theprice of the in-flight meal), but its demand pattern is subject toextreme cyclical swings.The numbers are interesting. Let's do a calculation in the spirit ofChapter \ref{ch:guesstimation}. A modern jet airplane costs about\$100M new and has a useful service life of about 10 years. The costattributable to a single 10-hour transatlantic flight (thedepreciation---see below) comes to about \$30k (\ie,$\text{\$100M}/(10\cdot365)$---half that, if the plane is turnedaround immediately, completing a full round-trip within 24 hours).Fuel consumption is about 6 gallons per mile; if we assume a fuelprice of \$2 per gallon, then the 4,000-mile flight between New Yorkand Frankfurt (Germany) will cost \$50k for fuel. Let's say there are10 members of the cabin crew at \$50k yearly salary and two people inthe cockpit at \$150k each. Double these numbers for miscellaneousbenefits, and we end up with about \$2M in yearly labor costs, or \$10kattributable to this one flight. In contrast, the cost of an in-flightmeal (wholesale) is probably less than \$10 per person.  For a flightwith 200 passengers, this amounts to \$1,000--2,000 dollars total.  Itis interesting to see that---all things considered---the influence ofthe in-flight meal on the overall cost structure of the flight is ashigh as it is: about 2 percent of the total. In a business with thinmargins, improving profitability by 2 percent is usually seen asworthwhile.\vadjust{\pagebreak}  In other words, we should be grateful that we get\emph{anything} at all! A final cross-check: the cost per passengerfor the entire flight from the airline's point of view is \$375---andat the time of this writing, the cheapest fare I could find was \$600round-trip, equivalent to \$300 for a single leg.  As is well known,airlines break even on economy class passengers but don't make anyprofits.\subsection{Capital Expenditure and Operating Cost}\index{capital expenditures}\index{operating costs}  Our final distinction is the one between \emph{capital expenditure}(CapEx) and \emph{operating expense} (OpEx---the abbreviation israrely used). Capital expenses are money spent to purchase long-livedand typically tangible assets: equipment, installations, real estate.Operating expenses are everything else: payments for rents, rawmaterials, fees, salaries. In most companies, separate budgets existfor both types of expense, and the availability of funds may be quitedifferent for each. For example, in a company that is financiallystrapped but does have a revenue stream, it might be quite acceptableto hire and ``throw people'' at a problem (even at great cost), but itmight very well be impossible to buy a piece of equipment that wouldtake care of the problem for good. Conversely, in companies that dohave money in the bank, it is often \emph{easier} to get a lump sumapproved for a specific purchase than to hire more people or toperform maintenance. Decision makers often are more inclined toapprove funding for an identifiable and visible purchase than forspending money on ``business as usual.'' Political and vanityconsiderations may play a role as well.The distinction between CapEx and operating costs is importantbecause, depending on the availability of funds from either source,different solutions will be seen as feasible. (I refer to suchconsiderations as ``color of money'' issues---although all dollars aregreen, some are greener than others!)In the context of capital expenditure, there is one more concept thatI'd like to introduce because it provides an interesting and oftenuseful way of thinking about money: the notion of\emph{depreciation}.\index{depreciation}\footnote{Do not confuse \emph{to depreciate},  which is the process by which an asset loses value over time, with  \emph{to deprecate}, which is an expression of disapproval. The  latter word is used most often to mark certain parts of a software  program or library as \emph{deprecated}, meaning that they should no  longer be used in future work.} The idea is this: any piece ofequipment that we purchase will have a useful service life. We can nowdistribute the total cost of that purchase across the entire life ofthe asset. For example, if I purchase a car for \$24,000 and expect todrive it for 10 years, then I can say that this car costs me \$200 permonth ``in depreciation'' alone and before taking into account anyoperating costs (such as gas and insurance). I may want to comparethis number with monthly lease payment options on the same kind ofvehicle.In other words, depreciation is a formalized way of capturing how anasset loses value over time. There are different standard ways tocalculate it: ``straight-line'' distributes the purchase cost (lessany \emph{salvage value} that\vadjust{\pagebreak} we might expect to obtain for the assetat the end of its life) evenly over the service life. The ``decliningbalance'' method assumes that the asset loses a certain constantfraction of its value every year. And so on.  (Interestingly, land isnever depreciated---because it does not wear out in the way a machinedoes and therefore does not have a finite service life.)I find depreciation a useful concept, because it provides a good wayto think about large capital expenses: as an ongoing cost rather thanas an occasional lump sum. But depreciation is just that: a way ofthinking. It is important to understand that depreciation is\emph{not} a cash flow and therefore does not show up in any sort offinancial accounting. What's in the books is the money actually spent,when it is spent.The only occasion where depreciation is treated as a cash flow is whenit comes to taxes. The IRS (the U.S.\ tax authority) requires thatcertain long-lived assets purchased for business purposes bedepreciated over a number of years, with the annual depreciationcounted as a business expense for that year. For this reason,depreciation is usually introduced in conjunction with taxconsiderations. But I find the concept more generally useful as a wayto think about and account for the cost of assets and their decliningvalue over time.\index{financial calculations!cost concepts and depreciation|)} \index{costs!cost concepts and depreciation|)}% ============================================================\section{Should You Care?}\index{financial calculations!issues|(} What does all this talk about money, business plans, and investmentdecisions have to do with data analysis? Why should you even care?That depends. If you take a purely technical stance, then all of thesequestions are outside your area of competence and responsibility.That's a valid position to take, and many practitioners will makeexactly that decision.Personally, I disagree. I don't see it as my job to provide\emph{answers} to \emph{questions}. I see it as my responsibility toprovide \emph{solutions} to \emph{problems}, and to do thiseffectively, I need to understand the context in which questions arise,and I need to understand how answers will be evaluated and used.Furthermore, when it comes to questions having to do with abstracttopics like data and mathematical modeling, I have found that fewclients are in a good position to ask meaningful questions.\emph{Coaching} the client on what makes a good question (one that isboth operational for me and actionable for the client) is therefore alarge part of what I do---and to do that, I must understand and speakthe client's language.There are two more reasons why I find it important to understandissues such as those discussed in this (and the previous) chapter:to establish my own \emph{credibility} and to provide advice andcounsel on the \emph{mathematical details} involved.The decision makers---that is, the people who request and use theresults of a data analysis study---are ``business people.''  They tendto see decisions as \emph{investment} decisions and thus will evaluatethem using the methods and terminology introduced in this chapter.Unless I understand how they will look\vadjust{\pagebreak}  at my results and unless I candefend my results in those terms, I will be on weakground---especially since I am supposed to be ``the expert.'' Ilearned this the hard way: once, while presenting the results of arather sophisticated and involved analysis, some MBA bully fresh outof business school challenged me with: ``OK, now which of theseoptions has the best discounted net cash flow?''  I had no idea whathe was talking about. I looked like an idiot.  That did \emph{not}help my credibility! (No matter how right I was in everything else Iwas presenting.)Another reason why I think it is important to understand the conceptsin this chapter is that the math can get a little tricky. This is whythe standard textbooks resort to large collections of precookedscenarios---which is not only confusing but can become downrightmisleading if none of them fit exactly and people start combiningseveral of the standard solutions in ad hoc (and probably incorrect)ways. Often the most important skill I bring to the table is basiccalculus. In one place I worked for, which was actually staffed bysome of the smartest people in the industry, I discovered a problembecause people did not fully understand the difference between $1/x$and $-x$. Of course, if you put it like this, everybody understandsthe difference. But if you muddy the waters a little bit and presentthe problem in the business domain setting in which it arose, it's nolonger so easy to see the difference. (And I virtually guarantee youthat nobody will understand why $1/(1-x)$ is actually close to $1-x$for small $x$, when $1/x$ is not equal $-x$.)In my experience, the correct and meaningful application of basic mathoutside a purely mathematical environment poses a nearlyinsurmountable challenge even for otherwise very bright people.Understanding exactly what people are trying to do (\eg, incalculating a total rate of return) allows me to help them avoidserious mistakes.But in the end, I think the most important reason for mastering thismaterial is to be able to understand the \emph{context} in whichquestions arise and to be able to answer those questionsappropriately with a sense for the \emph{purpose} driving the originalrequest.\vspace*{-9pt}% ============================================================\section{Is This All That Matters?}In this chapter, we discussed several financial concepts and how to usethem when deciding between different business or investment options.This begs the question: are these the only issues that matter? Shouldyou automatically opt for the choice with the highest net presentvalue and be done with it?Of course, the short answer is no. Other aspects matter and may evenbe more important (strategic vision, sustainability, human factors,personal interest, commitment). What makes these factors different isthat they are \emph{intangible}. You have to decide on them yourself.The methods and concepts discussed in this chapter deal specificallyand exclusively with the \emph{financial} implications of certaindecisions. Those concerns are important---otherwise, you would noteven \emph{be} in business. But this focus should not be taken toimply that financial considerations are the \emph{only} ones thatmatter.\pagebreakHowever, I am in no better position than you to give advice on ethicalquestions. It's up to each of us individually---what kind of life dowe want to live?\index{financial calculations!issues|)} % ============================================================\section{Workshop: The Newsvendor Problem}\index{financial calculations!newsvendor problem|(} In this workshop, I'd like to introduce one more idea that is oftenrelevant when dealing with business plans and calculations on how to findthe optimal price or, alternatively, the optimal inventory level forsome item. The basic problem is often presented in the followingterms.Imagine you run a newsstand. In the morning, you buy a certain number$n$ of newspapers at price $c_0$. Over the course of the day, you tryto sell this inventory at price $c_1$; anything that isn't sold in theevening is discarded (no salvage value). If you knew how many papersyou would actually sell during the course of the day (the\emph{demand} $m$), then it would be easy: you would buy exactly $m$papers in the morning. However, the demand is not known exactly,although we know the probability $p(k)$ of selling exactly $k$ copies.The question is: how many papers should you buy in the morning inorder to maximize your net earnings (the \emph{revenue})?\begin{figure}  \centerline{\includegraphics{img/newsboy}}  \caption{Simulation results for the newsvendor problem: total    revenue as a function of the initial inventory, for several values    of the sales price $c_1$. Also shown is the (theoretical) locus of    the initial inventory size that leads to maximum revenue.  \label{fig:newsboy}}\vspace*{-9pt}\end{figure}A first guess might be to use the average number of papers that weexpect to sell---that is, the mean of $p(k)$. However, this approachmay not be good enough: suppose that $c_1$ is much larger than $c_0$(so that your markup is high). In that case, it makes sense to purchasemore papers in the hope of selling them, because\vadjust{\pagebreak}  the gain from sellingan additional paper outweighs the loss from having purchased too many.(In other words, the \emph{opportunity cost} that we incur if we havetoo few papers to satisfy all demand is greater than the cost ofpurchasing the inventory.) The converse also holds: if the markup issmall, then each unsold paper significantly reduces our overallrevenue.This problem lends itself nicely to simulations. The listing thatfollows shows a minimal program for simulating the newsvendor problem.We fix the purchase price $c_0$ at \$1 and read the projected salesprice $c_1$ from the command line. For the demand, we assume aGaussian distribution with mean $\mu = 100$ and standard deviation$\sigma = 10$. Now, for each possible initial level of inventory $n$,we make 1,000 random trials.  Each trial corresponds to a single``day''; we randomly generate a level of demand $m$ and calculate theresulting revenue for that day.  The revenue consists of the salesprice for the number of units that were actually sold \emph{less} thepurchase price for the inventory. You should convince yourself thatthe number of units sold is the lesser of the inventory and thedemand: in the first case, we sold out; in the second case, we endedup discarding inventory.  Finally, we average all trials for thecurrent level of starting inventory and print the average revenuegenerated. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:newsboy} forseveral different sales prices $c_1$:\vspace*{3pt}\begin{verbatim}from sys import argvfrom random import gaussc0, c1 = 1.0, float( argv[1] )mu, sigma = 100, 10maxtrials = 1000for n in range( mu-5*sigma, mu+5*sigma ):    avg = 0    for trial in range( maxtrials ):        m = int( 0.5 + gauss( mu, sigma ) )               r = c1*min( n, m ) - c0*n        avg += r            print c1, n, avg/maxtrials\end{verbatim}Of course, the total revenue depends on the actual sales price---thehigher the price, the more we take home. But we can also see that, foreach value of the sales price, the revenue curve has a maximum at adifferent horizontal location. The corresponding value of $n$ gives usthe optimal initial inventory level for that sales price.  Thus wehave achieved our objective: we have found the optimal number ofnewspapers to buy at the beginning of the day to maximize ourearnings.This simple idea can be extended in different ways.  More complicatedsituations may involve \emph{different} types of items, each with itsown demand distribution. How much of each item should we hold ininventory now?  Alternatively, we can turn the problem around byasking: given a fixed inventory, what would be the optimal\emph{price} to maximize earnings? To answer this question, we need toknow how the demand varies as we change the price---that is, we needto know the \emph{demand curve}, which takes the role of the demanddistribution in our example.\subsection{Optional: Exact Solution}For this particular example, involving only a single type of productat a fixed price, we can actually work out the optimum exactly. (Thismeans that running a simulation wasn't strictly necessary in thiscase. Nevertheless, this is one of those cases where a simulation mayactually be easier to do and less error-prone than an analyticalmodel. For more complicated scenarios, such as those involvingdifferent types of items with different demands, simulations areunavoidable.)To solve this problem analytically, we want to find the optimum of theexpected revenue. The revenue---as we already saw in our examplesimulation program---is given by%\[r(m) = c_1 \min( n, m ) - c_0 n\]%The revenue depends on the demand $m$. However, the demand is a randomquantity: all that we know is that it is distributed according to somedistribution $p(m)$. The \emph{expected revenue} $E[r(m)]$ is theaverage of the revenue over all possible values of $m$, where eachvalue is weighted by the appropriate probability factor:%\[E[ r(m) ] = \int_0^\infty \! r(m) \, p(m) \rms{m}\]%We can now plug in the previous expression for $r(m)$, using thelesser of $n$ and $m$ in the integral:%\begin{align*}E[ r(m) ] & = c_1 \int_0^n \! m \, p(m) \rms{m}            + c_1 \int_n^\infty \! n \, p(m) \rms{m}             - c_0 n \int_0^\infty \! p(m) \rms{m} \\          & = c_1 \int_0^n \! m \, p(m) \rms{m}            + c_1 n \paren{ 1 - \int_0^n \! p(m) \rms{m} }            - c_0 n\end{align*}%where we have made use of the fact that $\int_0^\infty p(m) \rms{m} =1$ and that $\int_0^n p(m) \rms{m} + \int_n^\infty p(m) \rms{m} =\int_0^\infty p(m) \rms{m}$.We now want to find the maximum of the expected revenue with respectto the initial inventory level $n$. To locate the maximum, we firsttake the derivative with respect to $n$:%\begin{align*}\Diff{n} E[ r(m) ] & = c_1 \, n \, p(n)                     + c_1 \paren{ 1 - \int_0^n \! p(m) \rms{m} }                     - c_1 \, n \, p(n)                     - c_0 \\                   & = c_1 - c_0 - c_1 \int_0^n \! p(m) \rms{m}\end{align*}%where we have used the product rule and the fundamental theoremof calculus: $\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}x}\int^x f(s) \rms{s} = f(x)$.Next we equate the derivative to zero (that is the condition for themaximum) and rearrange terms to find%\[\int_0^n \! p(m) \rms{m} = 1 - \frac{c_0}{c_1}\]%This is the final result. The lefthand side is the \emph{cumulative  distribution function} of the demand, and the righthand side is asimple expression involving the ratio of the purchase price and thesales price. Given the cumulative distribution function for thedemand, we can now find the value of $n$ for which the cumulativedistribution function equals $1-c_0/c_1$---that value of $n$ is theoptimal initial inventory level.The lighter dotted line in Figure \ref{fig:newsboy} shows the locationof the optimum revenue obtained by plugging the optimal inventorycalculated in this way back into the expression for the revenue. As wewould expect, this line goes right through the peaks in all therevenue curves.  Notice that the maximum in the revenue curve occursfor $n < 100$ for $c_1 < 2.00$: in other words, our markup has to beat least 100 percent, before it makes sense to hold \emph{more}inventory than the expected average demand. (Remember that we expectto sell 100 papers on average.) If our markup is less than that, thenwe are better-off selling our inventory out entirely, rather thanhaving to discard some items.  (Of course, details such as thesedepend on the specific choice of the probability distribution $p(m)$that is used to model the demand.)\index{financial calculations!newsvendor problem|)}\vspace*{10pt}% ============================================================\section{Further Reading}If you want to read up on some of the details that I have (quiteintentionally) skipped, you should look for material on ``engineeringeconomics'' or ``engineering economic analysis.''
