\chapter{Preface}

\section*{The strange history of this book}

In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming
class in Java.  I had taught it three times and I was getting
frustrated.  The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for
students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.

One of the problems I saw was the books.  
They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and
not enough high-level guidance about how to program.  And they all
suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy,
proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would
fall out.  The students would get too much new material, too fast,
and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.

Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my
own book.  
My goals were:

\begin{itemize}

\item Keep it short.  It is better for students to read 10 pages
than not read 50 pages.

\item Be careful with vocabulary.  I tried to minimize the jargon
and define each term at first use.

\item Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult
topics and split them into a series of small steps. 

\item Focus on programming, not the programming language.  I included
the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.

\end{itemize}

I needed a title, so on a whim I chose {\em How to Think Like
a Computer Scientist}.

My first version was rough, but it worked.  Students did the reading,
and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard
topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the
students practice.

I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License,
which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.
\index{GNU Free Documentation License}
\index{Free Documentation License, GNU}

What happened next is the cool part.  Jeff Elkner, a high school
teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into
Python.  He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the
unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book.
As Green Tea Press, I published the first Python version in 2001.
\index{Elkner, Jeff}

In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach
Python for the first time.  The contrast with Java was striking.
Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting
projects, and generally had a lot more fun.
\index{Olin College}

Over the last nine years I continued to develop the book,
correcting errors, improving some of the examples and
adding material, especially exercises.

The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title
{\em Think Python}.  Some of the changes are:

\begin{itemize}

\item I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter.
  These sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding
  bugs, and warnings about Python pitfalls.

\item I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of
  understanding to a few substantial projects.  And I wrote
  solutions for most of them.

\item I added a series of case studies---longer examples with
  exercises, solutions, and discussion.  Some are based on
  Swampy, a suite of Python programs I wrote for use in my classes.
  Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from
  \url{http://thinkpython.com}.
  
\item I expanded the discussion of program development plans
  and basic design patterns.

\item I added appendices about debugging, analysis of algorithms, and
  UML diagrams with Lumpy.

\end{itemize}

I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps
you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like
a computer scientist.

\chapter{The way of the program}

The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a
computer scientist.  This way of thinking combines some of the best features
of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.  Like mathematicians,
computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically
computations).  Like engineers, they design things, assembling components
into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives.  Like scientists,
they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test
predictions.
\index{problem solving}

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is {\bf
problem solving}.  Problem solving means the ability to formulate
problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly
and accurately.  As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an
excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills.  That's why
this chapter is called, ``The way of the program.''

On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful
skill by itself.  On another level, you will use programming as a means to
an end.  As we go along, that end will become clearer.

\section{The Python programming language}
\index{programming language}
\index{language!programming}

The programming language you will learn is Python. Python is
an example of a {\bf high-level language}; other high-level languages
you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java.

There are
also {\bf low-level languages}, sometimes referred to as ``machine
languages'' or ``assembly languages.''  Loosely speaking, computers
can only run programs written in low-level languages.  So
programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before
they can run.  This extra processing takes some time, which is a small
disadvantage of high-level languages.
\index{portability}
\index{high-level language}
\index{low-level language}
\index{language!high-level}
\index{language!low-level}

The advantages are enormous.  First, it is much easier to program
in a high-level language.  Programs written in a high-level language
take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they
are more likely to be correct.  Second, high-level languages are {\bf
portable}, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers
with few or no modifications.  Low-level programs can run on only one
kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.

Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level
languages.  Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized
applications.
\index{compile}
\index{interpret}

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages
into low-level languages: {\bf interpreters} and {\bf compilers}.
An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it
does what the program says.  It processes the program a little at a time,
alternately reading lines and performing computations.
\index{source code}
\index{object code}
\index{executable}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{figs/interpret.pdf}}
\caption{An interpreter processes the program a little at a time,
alternately reading lines and performing computations.}
\label{fig.interpret}
\end{figure}

A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the
program starts running.  In this context, the high-level program is
called the {\bf source code}, and the translated program is called the
{\bf object code} or the {\bf executable}.  Once a program is
compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{figs/compile.pdf}}
\caption{A compiler translates source code into object code, which is
run by a hardware executor.}
\label{fig.compile}
\end{figure}

Python is considered an interpreted language because Python programs
are executed by an interpreter.  There are two ways to use the
interpreter: {\bf interactive mode} and {\bf script mode}. In
interactive mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter displays
the result:
\index{interactive mode}
\index{script mode}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 1 + 1
2
\end{verbatim}
%
The chevron, {\tt >>>}, is the
{\bf prompt} the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready.  If
you type {\tt 1 + 1}, the interpreter replies {\tt 2}.
\index{prompt}

Alternatively, you can store code in a file and use the interpreter to
execute the contents of the file, which is called a {\bf script}.  By
convention, Python scripts have names that end with {\tt .py}.
\index{script}

To execute the script, you have to tell the interpreter the name of
the file.  If you have a script named {\tt dinsdale.py} and you are
working in a UNIX command window, you type {\tt python
dinsdale.py}.  In other development environments, the details of
executing scripts are different.  You can find instructions for
your environment at the Python website \url{http://python.org}.
\index{testing!interactive mode}

Working in interactive mode is convenient for testing small pieces of
code because you can type and execute them immediately.  But for
anything more than a few lines, you should save your code
as a script so you can modify and execute it in the future.


\section{What is a program?}

A {\bf program} is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to
perform a computation.  The computation might be something
mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the
roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such
as searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough)
compiling a program.
\index{program}

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic
instructions appear in just about every language:

\begin{description}

\item[input:] Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some
other device.

\item[output:] Display data on the screen or send data to a
file or other device.

\item[math:] Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
multiplication.

\item[conditional execution:] Check for certain conditions and
execute the appropriate code.

\item[repetition:] Perform some action repeatedly, usually with
some variation.

\end{description}

Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it.  Every
program you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of
instructions that look pretty much like these.  So you can think of
programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task
into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are
simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions.
\index{algorithm}

That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic
when we talk about {\bf algorithms}.

\section{What is debugging?}
\index{debugging}
\index{bug}

Programming is error-prone.  For whimsical reasons, programming errors
are called {\bf bugs} and the process of tracking them down is called
{\bf debugging}.
\index{debugging}
\index{bug}

Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime 
errors, and semantic errors. It is useful
to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.

\subsection{Syntax errors}
\index{syntax error}
\index{error!syntax}
\index{error message}

Python can only execute a program if the syntax is
correct; otherwise, the interpreter displays an error message.
{\bf Syntax} refers to the structure of a program and the rules about
that structure. \index{syntax} 
For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so
{\tt (1 + 2)} is legal, but {\tt 8)} is a {\bf syntax error}.
\index{parentheses!matching}
\index{syntax}
\index{cummings, e. e.}

In English readers can tolerate most syntax errors, which is why we
can read the poetry of e. e. cummings without spewing error messages.
Python is not so forgiving.  If there is a single syntax error
anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message and quit,
and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few
weeks of your programming career, you will probably spend a lot of
time tracking down syntax errors.  As you gain experience, you will
make fewer errors and find them faster.

\subsection{Runtime errors}
\label{runtime}

The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the
error does not appear until after the program has started running.
These errors are also called {\bf exceptions} because they usually
indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.
\index{runtime error}
\index{error!runtime}
\index{exception}
\index{safe language}
\index{language!safe}

Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the
first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.


\subsection{Semantic errors}
\index{semantics}
\index{semantic error}
\index{error!semantic}
\index{error message}

The third type of error is the {\bf semantic error}.  If there is a
semantic error in your program, it will run successfully in the sense
that the computer will not generate any error messages, but it will
not do the right thing.  It will do something else.  Specifically, it
will do what you told it to do.

The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you
wanted to write.  The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong.
Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work
backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure
out what it is doing.

\subsection{Experimental debugging}

One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging.
Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most
intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of
programming.
\index{experimental debugging}
\index{debugging!experimental}

In some ways, debugging is like detective work.  You are confronted
with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led
to the results you see.

Debugging is also like an experimental science.  Once you have an idea
about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again.  If
your hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the result of the
modification, and you take a step closer to a working program.  If
your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one.  As
Sherlock Holmes pointed out, ``When you have eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.''
(A. Conan Doyle, {\em The Sign of Four})
\index{Holmes, Sherlock}
\index{Doyle, Arthur Conan}

For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing.  That
is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until
it does what you want.  The idea is that you should start with a
program that does {\em something} and make small modifications,
debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program.

For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of
lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds
used to explore the Intel 80386 chip.  According to Larry Greenfield,
``One of Linus's earlier projects was a program that would switch
between printing AAAA and BBBB.  This later evolved to Linux.''
({\em The Linux Users' Guide} Beta Version 1).
\index{Linux}

Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other
programming practices.


\section{Formal and natural languages}
\index{formal language}
\index{natural language}
\index{language!formal}
\index{language!natural}

{\bf Natural languages} are the languages people speak,
such as English, Spanish, and French.  They were not designed
by people (although people try to impose some order on them);
they evolved naturally.

{\bf Formal languages} are languages that are designed by people for
specific applications.  For example, the notation that mathematicians
use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting
relationships among numbers and symbols.  Chemists use a formal
language to represent the chemical structure of molecules.  And
most importantly:

\begin{quote}
{\bf Programming languages are formal languages that have been
designed to express computations.}
\end{quote}

Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax.  For example,
$3 + 3 = 6$ is a syntactically correct mathematical statement, but 
$3 + = 3 \mbox{\$} 6$ is not.
$H_2O$ is a syntactically correct
chemical formula, but $_2Zz$ is not.

Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to {\bf tokens} and
structure.  Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as
words, numbers, and chemical elements.  One of the problems with
$3 + = 3 \mbox{\$} 6$ is that \( \$ \) is not a legal token in mathematics
(at least as far as I know).  Similarly, $_2Zz$ is not legal because
there is no element with the abbreviation $Zz$.
\index{token}
\index{structure}

The second type of syntax error pertains to the structure of a
statement; that is, the way the tokens are arranged.  The statement
$3 + = 3$ is illegal because even though $+$ and $=$ are
legal tokens, you can't have one right after the other.  Similarly,
in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not
before.

\begin{exercise}

Write a well-structured English
sentence with invalid tokens in it.  Then write another sentence
with all valid tokens but with invalid structure.

\end{exercise}

When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal
language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is
(although in a natural language you do this subconsciously).  This
process is called {\bf parsing}.
\index{parse}

For example, when you hear the sentence, ``The penny dropped,'' you
understand that ``the penny'' is the subject and ``dropped'' is the
predicate.  Once you have parsed a sentence, you can figure out what it
means, or the semantics of the sentence.  Assuming that you know
what a penny is and what it means to drop, you will understand the
general implication of this sentence.

Although formal and natural languages have many features in
common---tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics---there are some
differences:
\index{ambiguity}
\index{redundancy}
\index{literalness}

\begin{description}

\item[ambiguity:] Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which
people deal with by using contextual clues and other information.
Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous,
which means that any statement has exactly one meaning,
regardless of context.

\item[redundancy:] In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce
misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of
redundancy.  As a result, they are often verbose.  Formal languages
are less redundant and more concise.

\item[literalness:] Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor.
If I say, ``The penny dropped,'' there is probably no penny and
nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone realized something
after a period of confusion).  Formal languages
mean exactly what they say.

\end{description}

People who grow up speaking a natural language---everyone---often have a
hard time adjusting to formal languages.  In some ways, the difference
between formal and natural language is like the difference between
poetry and prose, but more so:
\index{poetry}
\index{prose}

\begin{description}

\item[Poetry:] Words are used for their sounds as well as for
their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or
emotional response.  Ambiguity is not only common but often
deliberate.

\item[Prose:] The literal meaning of words is more important,
and the structure contributes more meaning.  Prose is more amenable to
analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.

\item[Programs:] The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous
and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the
tokens and structure.

\end{description}

Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal
languages).  First, remember that formal languages are much more dense
than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them.  Also, the
structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea to read
from top to bottom, left to right.  Instead, learn to parse the
program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the
structure.  Finally, the details matter.  Small errors in
spelling and punctuation, which you can get away
with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal
language.


\section{The first program}
\label{hello}
\index{Hello, World}

Traditionally, the first program you write in a new language
is called ``Hello, World!'' because all it does is display the
words ``Hello, World!''.  In Python, it looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
print 'Hello, World!'
\end{verbatim}
%
This is an example of a {\bf print statement}, which
doesn't actually print anything on paper.  It displays a value on the
screen.  In this case, the result is the words

\begin{verbatim}
Hello, World!
\end{verbatim}
%
The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end
of the text to be displayed; they don't appear in the result.
\index{quotation mark}
\index{print statement}
\index{statement!print}

In Python 3, the syntax for printing is slightly different:

\begin{verbatim}
print('Hello, World!')
\end{verbatim}
%
The parentheses indicate that {\tt print} is a function.  We'll get
to functions in Chapter~\ref{funcchap}.
\index{function} \index{print function} \index{Python 3}

For the rest of this book, I'll use the print statement.  If you
are using Python 3, you will have to translate.  But other than
that, there are very few differences we have to worry about.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can
try out the examples as you go.  You can run most of the examples in
interactive mode, but if you put the code in a script, it is easier
to try out variations.

Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try
to make mistakes.  For example, in the ``Hello, world!'' program,
what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks?  What
if you leave out both?  What if you spell {\tt print} wrong?
\index{error message}

This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps
with debugging, because you get to know what the error messages mean.
It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later
and accidentally.

Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong
emotions.  If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might 
feel angry, despondent or embarrassed.

There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if
they were people.  When they work well, we think
of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we
respond to them the same way we respond to rude,
obstinate people (Reeves and Nass, {\it The Media
    Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media
    Like Real People and Places}).
\index{debugging!emotional response}
\index{emotional debugging}

Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them.
One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with
certain strengths, like speed and precision, and
particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability
to grasp the big picture.

Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage
of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses.  And find ways
to use your emotions to engage with the problem,
without letting your reactions interfere with your ability
to work effectively.

Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill
that is useful for many activities beyond programming.  At the
end of each chapter there is a debugging section, like this one,
with my thoughts about debugging.  I hope they help!

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}

Use a web browser to go to the Python website \url{http://python.org}.
This page contains information about Python and links
to Python-related pages, and it gives you the ability to search
the Python documentation.

For example, if you enter {\tt print} in the search window, the
first link that appears is the documentation of the {\tt print}
statement.  At this point, not all of it will make sense to you,
but it is good to know where it is.
\index{documentation}
\index{python.org}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Start the Python interpreter and type {\tt help()} to start the online
help utility.  Or you can type \verb"help('print')" to get information
about the {\tt print} statement.

If this example doesn't work, you
may need to install additional Python documentation or set an
environment variable; the details depend on your operating system and
version of Python.
\index{help utility}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.
Python's syntax for math operations is almost the same as
standard mathematical notation.  For example, the symbols
{\tt +}, {\tt -} and {\tt /} denote addition, subtraction
and division, as you would expect.  The symbol for
multiplication is {\tt *}.

If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your
average time per mile?  What is your average speed in miles per hour?
(Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

\end{exercise}




\chapter{Variables, expressions and statements}

\section{Values and types}
\index{value}
\index{type}
\index{string}

A {\bf value} is one of the basic things a program works with,
like a letter or a
number.  The values we have seen so far
are {\tt 1}, {\tt 2}, and
\verb"'Hello, World!'".

These values belong to different {\bf types}:
{\tt 2} is an integer, and \verb"'Hello, World!'" is a {\bf string},
so-called because it contains a ``string'' of letters.
You (and the interpreter) can identify
strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.
\index{quotation mark}

If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type('Hello, World!')
<type 'str'>
>>> type(17)
<type 'int'>
\end{verbatim}
%
Not surprisingly, strings belong to the type {\tt str} and
integers belong to the type {\tt int}.  Less obviously, numbers
with a decimal point belong to a type called {\tt float},
because these numbers are represented in a
format called {\bf floating-point}.
\index{type}
\index{string type}
\index{type!str}
\index{int type}
\index{type!int}
\index{float type}
\index{type!float}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(3.2)
<type 'float'>
\end{verbatim}
%
What about values like \verb"'17'" and \verb"'3.2'"?
They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like
strings.
\index{quotation mark}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type('17')
<type 'str'>
>>> type('3.2')
<type 'str'>
\end{verbatim}
%
They're strings.

When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas
between groups of three digits, as in {\tt 1,000,000}.  This is not a
legal integer in Python, but it is legal:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 1,000,000
(1, 0, 0)
\end{verbatim}
%
Well, that's not what we expected at all!  Python interprets {\tt
  1,000,000} as a comma-separated sequence of integers.
This is the first example we have seen of a semantic error: the code
runs without producing an error message, but it doesn't do the
``right'' thing.
\index{semantic error}
\index{error!semantic}
\index{error message}



\section{Variables}
\label{variables}
\index{variable}
\index{assignment statement}
\index{statement!assignment}

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the
ability to manipulate {\bf variables}.  A variable is a name that
refers to a value.

An {\bf assignment statement} creates new variables and gives
them values:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
>>> n = 17
>>> pi = 3.1415926535897932
\end{verbatim}
%
This example makes three assignments.  The first assigns a string
to a new variable named {\tt message};
the second gives the integer {\tt 17} to {\tt n}; the third
assigns the (approximate) value of $\pi$ to {\tt pi}.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}

A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with
an arrow pointing to the variable's value.  This kind of figure is
called a {\bf state diagram} because it shows what state each of the
variables is in (think of it as the variable's state of mind).
Figure~\ref{fig.state2} shows the result of the previous example.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/state2.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.state2}
\end{figure}

The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(message)
<type 'str'>
>>> type(n)
<type 'int'>
>>> type(pi)
<type 'float'>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{exercise}

If you type an integer with a leading zero, you might get
a confusing error:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> zipcode = 02492
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid token
\end{verbatim}

Other numbers seem to work, but the results are bizarre:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> zipcode = 02132
>>> zipcode
1114
\end{verbatim}

Can you figure out what is going on?  Hint: display the
values {\tt 01}, {\tt 010}, {\tt 0100} and {\tt 01000}.
\index{octal}

\end{exercise}



\section{Variable names and keywords}
\index{keyword}

Programmers generally choose names for their variables that
are meaningful---they document what the variable is used for.

Variable names can be arbitrarily long.  They can contain
both letters and numbers, but they have to begin with a letter.
It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea
to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you'll
see why later).

The underscore character, \verb"_", can appear in a name.
It is often used in names with multiple words, such as
\verb"my_name" or \verb"airspeed_of_unladen_swallow".
\index{underscore character}

If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 76trombones = 'big parade'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> more@ = 1000000
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt 76trombones} is illegal because it does not begin with a letter.
{\tt more@} is illegal because it contains an illegal character, {\tt
@}.  But what's wrong with {\tt class}?

It turns out that {\tt class} is one of Python's {\bf keywords}.  The
interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program,
and they cannot be used as variable names.
\index{keyword}

Python 2 has 31 keywords:

\begin{verbatim}
and       del       from      not       while    
as        elif      global    or        with     
assert    else      if        pass      yield    
break     except    import    print              
class     exec      in        raise              
continue  finally   is        return             
def       for       lambda    try
\end{verbatim}
%
In Python 3, {\tt exec} is no longer a keyword, but {\tt nonlocal} is.

You might want to keep this list handy.  If the interpreter complains
about one of your variable names and you don't know why, see if it
is on this list.


\section{Operators and operands}
\index{operator, arithmetic}
\index{arithmetic operator}
\index{operand}
\index{expression}

{\bf Operators} are special symbols that represent computations like
addition and multiplication.  The values the operator is applied to
are called {\bf operands}.

The operators {\tt +}, {\tt -}, {\tt *}, {\tt /} and {\tt **}
perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and
exponentiation, as in the following examples:

\begin{verbatim}
20+32   hour-1   hour*60+minute   minute/60   5**2   (5+9)*(15-7)
\end{verbatim}
%
In some other languages, \verb"^" is used for exponentiation, but
in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR.  I won't cover
bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about
them at \url{http://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators}.
\index{bitwise operator}
\index{operator!bitwise}

In Python 2, the division operator might not do what you expect:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> minute = 59
>>> minute/60
0
\end{verbatim}
%
The value of {\tt minute} is 59, and in conventional arithmetic 59
divided by 60 is 0.98333, not 0.  The reason for the discrepancy is
that Python is performing {\bf floor division}.
When both of the operands are integers, the result is also an
integer; floor division chops off the fraction
part, so in this example it rounds down to zero.

In Python 3, the result of this division is a {\tt float}.  The new operator
{\tt //} performs floor division.
\index{Python 3}
\index{floor division}
\index{floating-point division}
\index{division!floor}
\index{division!floating-point}

If either of the operands is a floating-point number, Python performs
floating-point division, and the result is a {\tt float}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> minute/60.0
0.98333333333333328
\end{verbatim}


\section{Expressions and statements}

An {\bf expression} is a combination of values, variables, and operators.
A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is
a variable, so the following are all legal expressions
(assuming that the variable {\tt x} has been assigned a value):
\index{expression}
\index{evaluate}

\begin{verbatim}
17
x
x + 17
\end{verbatim}
%
A {\bf statement} is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can
execute.  We have seen two kinds of statement: print and
assignment.

Technically an expression is also a statement, but it is probably
simpler to think of them as different things.  The important difference
is that an expression has a value; a statement does not.


\section{Interactive mode and script mode}

One of the benefits of working with an interpreted language is that
you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them
in a script.  But there are differences between interactive mode
and script mode that can be confusing.
\index{interactive mode}
\index{script mode}

For example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type

\begin{verbatim}
>>> miles = 26.2
>>> miles * 1.61
42.182
\end{verbatim}

The first line assigns a value to {\tt miles}, but it has no visible
effect.  The second line is an expression, so the interpreter
evaluates it and displays the result.  So we learn that a marathon is
about 42 kilometers.

But if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no
output at all.  In script mode an expression, all by itself, has no
visible effect.  Python actually evaluates the expression, but it doesn't
display the value unless you tell it to:

\begin{verbatim}
miles = 26.2
print miles * 1.61
\end{verbatim}

This behavior can be confusing at first.

A script usually contains a sequence of statements.  If there
is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time
as the statements execute.

For example, the script

\begin{verbatim}
print 1
x = 2
print x
\end{verbatim}
%
produces the output

\begin{verbatim}
1
2
\end{verbatim}
%
The assignment statement produces no output.

\begin{exercise}

Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see
what they do:

\begin{verbatim}
5
x = 5
x + 1
\end{verbatim}
%
Now put the same statements into a script and run it.  What
is the output?  Modify the script by transforming each
expression into a print statement and then run it again.
\end{exercise}


\section{Order of operations}
\index{order of operations}
\index{rules of precedence}
\index{PEMDAS}

When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of
evaluation depends on the {\bf rules of precedence}.  For
mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention.
The acronym {\bf PEMDAS} is a useful way to
remember the rules:
\index{parentheses!overriding precedence}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf P}arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used 
to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since
expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, {\tt 2 * (3-1)} is 4,
and {\tt (1+1)**(5-2)} is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an
expression easier to read, as in {\tt (minute * 100) / 60}, even
if it doesn't change the result.

\item {\bf E}xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so
{\tt 2**1+1} is 3, not 4, and {\tt 3*1**3} is 3, not 27.

\item {\bf M}ultiplication and {\bf D}ivision have the same precedence,
which is higher than {\bf A}ddition and {\bf S}ubtraction, which also
have the same precedence.  So {\tt 2*3-1} is 5, not 4, and
{\tt 6+4/2} is 8, not 5.

\item Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to
  right (except exponentiation).  So in the expression {\tt degrees /
    2 * pi}, the division happens first and the result is multiplied
  by {\tt pi}.  To divide by $2 \pi$, you can use parentheses or write
  {\tt degrees / 2 / pi}.

\end{itemize}

I don't work very hard to remember rules of precedence for other
operators.  If I can't tell by looking at the expression, I use
parentheses to make it obvious.

\section{String operations}
\index{string!operation}
\index{operator!string}

In general, you can't perform mathematical operations on strings, even
if the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal:

\begin{verbatim}
'2'-'1'    'eggs'/'easy'    'third'*'a charm'
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt +} operator works with strings, but it
might not do what you expect: it performs
{\bf concatenation}, which means joining the strings by
linking them end-to-end.  For example:
\index{concatenation}

\begin{verbatim}
first = 'throat'
second = 'warbler'
print first + second
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of this program is {\tt throatwarbler}.

The {\tt *} operator also works on strings; it performs repetition.
For example, \verb"'Spam'*3" is \verb"'SpamSpamSpam'".  If one of the operands
is a string, the other has to be an integer.

This use of {\tt +} and {\tt *} makes sense by
analogy with addition and multiplication.  Just as {\tt 4*3} is
equivalent to {\tt 4+4+4}, we expect \verb"'Spam'*3" to be the same as
\verb"'Spam'+'Spam'+'Spam'", and it is.  On the other hand, there is a
significant way in which string concatenation and repetition are
different from integer addition and multiplication.
Can you think of a property that addition has
that string concatenation does not?
\index{commutativity}


\section{Comments}
\index{comment}

As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult
to read.  Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to
look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.

For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain
in natural language what the program is doing.  These notes are called
{\bf comments}, and they start with the \verb"#" symbol:

\begin{verbatim}
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60
\end{verbatim}
%
In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself.  You can also put
comments at the end of a line:

\begin{verbatim}
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour
\end{verbatim}
%
Everything from the {\tt \#} to the end of the line is ignored---it
has no effect on the program.

Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of
the code.  It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out
{\em what} the code does; it is much more useful to explain {\em why}.

This comment is redundant with the code and useless:

\begin{verbatim}
v = 5     # assign 5 to v
\end{verbatim}
%
This comment contains useful information that is not in the code:

\begin{verbatim}
v = 5     # velocity in meters/second. 
\end{verbatim}
%
Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but
long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is
a tradeoff.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

At this point the syntax error you are most likely to make is
an illegal variable name, like {\tt class} and {\tt yield}, which
are keywords, or \verb"odd~job" and \verb"US$", which contain
illegal characters.
\index{syntax error}
\index{error!syntax}

If you put a space in a variable name, Python thinks it is two
operands without an operator:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> bad name = 5
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
\end{verbatim}
%
For syntax errors, the error messages don't help much.
The most common messages are {\tt SyntaxError: invalid syntax} and
{\tt SyntaxError: invalid token}, neither of which is very informative.
\index{error message}
\index{use before def}
\index{exception}
\index{runtime error}
\index{error!runtime}

The runtime error you are most likely to make is a ``use before
def;'' that is, trying to use a variable before you have assigned
a value.  This can happen if you spell a variable name wrong:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> principal = 327.68
>>> interest = principle * rate
NameError: name 'principle' is not defined
\end{verbatim}
%
Variables names are case sensitive, so {\tt LaTeX} is not the
same as {\tt latex}.
\index{case-sensitivity, variable names}
\index{semantic error}
\index{error!semantic}

At this point the most likely cause of a semantic error is
the order of operations.  For example, to evaluate
 $\frac{1}{2 \pi}$,
you might be tempted to write

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 1.0 / 2.0 * pi
\end{verbatim}
%
But the division happens first, so you would get $\pi / 2$, which
is not the same thing!  There is no way for Python
to know what you meant to write, so in this case you don't
get an error message; you just get the wrong answer.

\chapter{Functions}
\label{funcchap}

\section{Function calls}
\label{functionchap}
\index{function call}

In the context of programming, a {\bf function} is a named sequence of
statements that performs a computation.  When you define a function,
you specify the name and the sequence of statements.  Later, you can
``call'' the function by name.  
We have already seen one example of a {\bf function call}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(32)
<type 'int'>
\end{verbatim}
%
The name of the function is {\tt type}.  The expression in parentheses
is called the {\bf argument} of the function.  The result, for this
function, is the type of the argument.
\index{parentheses!argument in}

It is common to say that a function ``takes'' an argument and ``returns''
a result.  The result is called the {\bf return value}.
\index{argument}
\index{return value}


\section{Type conversion functions}
\index{conversion!type}
\index{type conversion}

% from Elkner:
% comment on whether these things are _really_ functions?
% use max as an example of a built-in?

% my reply:
% they are on the list of ``built-in functions'' so I am
% willing to call them functions.

Python provides built-in functions that convert values
from one type to another.  The {\tt int} function takes any value and
converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:
\index{int function}
\index{function!int}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> int('32')
32
>>> int('Hello')
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt int} can convert floating-point values to integers, but it
doesn't round off; it chops off the fraction part:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> int(3.99999)
3
>>> int(-2.3)
-2
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt float} converts integers and strings to floating-point
numbers:
\index{float function}
\index{function!float}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> float(32)
32.0
>>> float('3.14159')
3.14159
\end{verbatim}
%
Finally, {\tt str} converts its argument to a string:
\index{str function}
\index{function!str}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> str(32)
'32'
>>> str(3.14159)
'3.14159'
\end{verbatim}
%



\section{Math functions}
\index{math function}
\index{function, math}

Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar
mathematical functions.  A {\bf module} is a file that contains a
collection of related functions.
\index{module}
\index{module object}

Before we can use the module, we have to import it:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import math
\end{verbatim}
%
This statement creates a {\bf module object} named math.  If
you print the module object, you get some information about it:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print math
<module 'math' (built-in)>
\end{verbatim}
%
The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the
module.  To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name
of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also
known as a period).  This format is called {\bf dot notation}.
\index{dot notation}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power
>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)

>>> radians = 0.7
>>> height = math.sin(radians)
\end{verbatim}
%
The first example uses \verb"log10" to compute 
a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that \verb"signal_power" and
\verb"noise_power" are defined).  The math module also provides {\tt log},
which computes logarithms base {\tt e}.
\index{log function}
\index{function!log}
\index{sine function}
\index{radian}
\index{trigonometric function}
\index{function, trigonometric}

The second example finds the sine of {\tt radians}.  The name of the
variable is a hint that {\tt sin} and the other trigonometric
functions ({\tt cos}, {\tt tan}, etc.)  take arguments in radians. To
convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by
$2 \pi$:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> degrees = 45
>>> radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi
>>> math.sin(radians)
0.707106781187
\end{verbatim}
%
The expression {\tt math.pi} gets the variable {\tt pi} from the math
module.  The value of this variable is an approximation
of $\pi$, accurate to about 15 digits.
\index{pi}

If you know
your trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to
the square root of two divided by two:
\index{sqrt function}
\index{function!sqrt}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0
0.707106781187
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Composition}
\index{composition}

So far, we have looked at the elements of a program---variables,
expressions, and statements---in isolation, without talking about how to
combine them.

One of the most useful features of programming languages is their
ability to take small building blocks and {\bf compose} them.  For
example, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression,
including arithmetic operators:

\begin{verbatim}
x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)
\end{verbatim}
%
And even function calls:

\begin{verbatim}
x = math.exp(math.log(x+1))
\end{verbatim}
%
Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary
expression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment
statement has to be a variable name.  Any other expression on the left
side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule
later).

\begin{verbatim}
>>> minutes = hours * 60                 # right
>>> hours * 60 = minutes                 # wrong!
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator
\end{verbatim}
%
\index{SyntaxError}
\index{exception!SyntaxError}


\section{Adding new functions}

So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python,
but it is also possible to add new functions.
A {\bf function definition} specifies the name of a new function and
the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.
\index{function}
\index{function definition}
\index{definition!function}

Here is an example:

\begin{verbatim}
def print_lyrics():
    print "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay."
    print "I sleep all night and I work all day."
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt def} is a keyword that indicates that this is a function
definition.  The name of the function is \verb"print_lyrics".  The
rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters,
numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character
can't be a number.  You can't use a keyword as the name of a function,
and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same
name.
\index{def keyword}
\index{keyword!def}
\index{argument}

The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function
doesn't take any arguments.
\index{parentheses!empty}
\index{header}
\index{body}
\index{indentation}
\index{colon}

The first line of the function definition is called the {\bf header};
the rest is called the {\bf body}.  The header has to end with a colon
and the body has to be indented.  By convention, the indentation is
always four spaces (see Section~\ref{editor}).  The body can contain
any number of statements.

The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double
quotes.  Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing;
most people use single quotes except in cases like this where
a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.
\index{ellipses}

If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter
prints ellipses ({\em ...}) to let you know that the definition
isn't complete:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> def print_lyrics():
...     print "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay."
...     print "I sleep all night and I work all day."
...
\end{verbatim}
%
To end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is
not necessary in a script).

Defining a function creates a variable with the same name.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print print_lyrics
<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>
>>> type(print_lyrics)
<type 'function'>
\end{verbatim}
%
The value of \verb"print_lyrics" is a {\bf function object}, which
has type \verb"'function'".
\index{function object}
\index{object!function}

The syntax for calling the new function is the same as
for built-in functions:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
\end{verbatim}
%
Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another
function.  For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write
a function called \verb"repeat_lyrics":

\begin{verbatim}
def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()
\end{verbatim}
%
And then call \verb"repeat_lyrics":

\begin{verbatim}
>>> repeat_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
\end{verbatim}
%
But that's not really how the song goes.


\section{Definitions and uses}
\index{function definition}

Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the
whole program looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
def print_lyrics():
    print "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay."
    print "I sleep all night and I work all day."

def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

repeat_lyrics()
\end{verbatim}
%
This program contains two function definitions: \verb"print_lyrics" and
\verb"repeat_lyrics".  Function definitions get executed just like other
statements, but the effect is to create function objects.  The statements
inside the function do not get executed until the function is called, and
the function definition generates no output.
\index{use before def}

As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can
execute it.  In other words, the function definition has to be
executed before the first time it is called.

\begin{exercise}

Move the last line of this program
to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run 
the program and see what error
message you get.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Move the function call back to the bottom
and move the definition of \verb"print_lyrics" after the definition of
\verb"repeat_lyrics".  What happens when you run this program?

\end{exercise}


\section{Flow of execution}
\index{flow of execution}

In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use,
you have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is
called the {\bf flow of execution}.

Execution always begins at the first statement of the program.
Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.

Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the
program, but remember that statements inside the function are not
executed until the function is called.

A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of
going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of
the function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back
to pick up where it left off.

That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can
call another.  While in the middle of one function, the program might
have to execute the statements in another function. But while
executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet
another function!

Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each
time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in
the function that called it.  When it gets to the end of the program,
it terminates.

What's the moral of this sordid tale?  When you read a program, you
don't always want to read from top to bottom.  Sometimes it makes
more sense if you follow the flow of execution.


\section{Parameters and arguments}
\label{parameters}
\index{parameter}
\index{function parameter}
\index{argument}
\index{function argument}

Some of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments.  For
example, when you call {\tt math.sin} you pass a number
as an argument.  Some functions take more than one argument:
{\tt math.pow} takes two, the base and the exponent.

Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to
variables called {\bf parameters}.  Here is an example of a
user-defined function that takes an argument:
\index{parentheses!parameters in}

\begin{verbatim}
def print_twice(bruce):
    print bruce
    print bruce
\end{verbatim}
%
This function assigns the argument to a parameter
named {\tt bruce}.  When the function is called, it prints the value of
the parameter (whatever it is) twice.

This function works with any value that can be printed.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print_twice('Spam')
Spam
Spam
>>> print_twice(17)
17
17
>>> print_twice(math.pi)
3.14159265359
3.14159265359
\end{verbatim}
%
The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also
apply to user-defined functions, so we can use any kind of expression
as an argument for \verb"print_twice":
\index{composition}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print_twice('Spam '*4)
Spam Spam Spam Spam
Spam Spam Spam Spam
>>> print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))
-1.0
-1.0
\end{verbatim}
%
The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so
in the examples the expressions \verb"'Spam '*4" and
{\tt math.cos(math.pi)} are only evaluated once.
\index{argument}

You can also use a variable as an argument:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'
>>> print_twice(michael)
Eric, the half a bee.
Eric, the half a bee.
\end{verbatim}
%
The name of the variable we pass as an argument ({\tt michael}) has
nothing to do with the name of the parameter ({\tt bruce}).  It
doesn't matter what the value was called back home (in the caller);
here in \verb"print_twice", we call everybody {\tt bruce}.


\section{Variables and parameters are local}
\index{local variable}
\index{variable!local}

When you create a variable inside a function, it is {\bf local},
which means that it only
exists inside the function.  For example:
\index{parentheses!parameters in}

\begin{verbatim}
def cat_twice(part1, part2):
    cat = part1 + part2
    print_twice(cat)
\end{verbatim}
%
This function takes two arguments, concatenates them, and prints
the result twice.  Here is an example that uses it:
\index{concatenation}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> line1 = 'Bing tiddle '
>>> line2 = 'tiddle bang.'
>>> cat_twice(line1, line2)
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.
\end{verbatim}
%
When \verb"cat_twice" terminates, the variable {\tt cat}
is destroyed.  If we try to print it, we get an exception:
\index{NameError}
\index{exception!NameError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print cat
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined
\end{verbatim}
%
Parameters are also local.
For example, outside \verb"print_twice", there is no
such thing as {\tt bruce}.
\index{parameter}


\section{Stack diagrams}
\label{stackdiagram}
\index{stack diagram}
\index{function frame}
\index{frame}

To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes
useful to draw a {\bf stack diagram}.  Like state diagrams, stack
diagrams show the value of each variable, but they also show the
function each variable belongs to.
\index{stack diagram}
\index{diagram!stack}

Each function is represented by a {\bf frame}.  A frame is a box
with the name of a function
beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it.
The stack diagram for the
previous example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig.stack}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/stack.pdf}}
\caption{Stack diagram.}
\label{fig.stack}
\end{figure}


The frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function
called which, and so on.  In this example, \verb"print_twice"
was called by \verb"cat_twice", and \verb"cat_twice" was called by 
\verb"__main__", which is a special name for the topmost frame.  When
you create a variable outside of any function, it belongs to 
\verb"__main__".

Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding
argument.  So, {\tt part1} has the same value as
{\tt line1}, {\tt part2} has the same value as {\tt line2},
and {\tt bruce} has the same value as {\tt cat}.

If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the
name of the function, and the name of the function that called
it, and the name of the function that called {\em that}, all the
way back to \verb"__main__".

For example, if you try to access {\tt cat} from within 
\verb"print_twice", you get a {\tt NameError}:

\begin{verbatim}
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "test.py", line 13, in __main__
    cat_twice(line1, line2)
  File "test.py", line 5, in cat_twice
    print_twice(cat)
  File "test.py", line 9, in print_twice
    print cat
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined
\end{verbatim}
%
This list of functions is called a {\bf traceback}.  It tells you what
program file the error occurred in, and what line, and what functions
were executing at the time.  It also shows the line of code that
caused the error.
\index{traceback}

The order of the functions in the traceback is the same as the
order of the frames in the stack diagram.  The function that is
currently running is at the bottom.


\section{Fruitful functions and void functions}
\index{fruitful function}
\index{void function}
\index{function, fruitful}
\index{function, void} 

Some of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield
results; for lack of a better name, I call them {\bf fruitful
  functions}.  Other functions, like \verb"print_twice", perform an
action but don't return a value.  They are called {\bf void
  functions}.

When you call a fruitful function, you almost always
want to do something with the result; for example, you might
assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:

\begin{verbatim}
x = math.cos(radians)
golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
\end{verbatim}
%
When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays
the result:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> math.sqrt(5)
2.2360679774997898
\end{verbatim}
%
But in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself,
the return value is lost forever!

\begin{verbatim}
math.sqrt(5)
\end{verbatim}
%
This script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn't store
or display the result, it is not very useful.
\index{interactive mode}
\index{script mode}

Void functions might display something on the screen or have some
other effect, but they don't have a return value.  If you try to
assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called
{\tt None}.
\index{None special value}
\index{special value!None}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> result = print_twice('Bing')
Bing
Bing
>>> print result
None
\end{verbatim}
%
The value {\tt None} is not the same as the string \verb"'None'". 
It is a special value that has its own type:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print type(None)
<type 'NoneType'>
\end{verbatim}
%
The functions we have written so far are all void.  We will start
writing fruitful functions in a few chapters.


\section{Why functions?}
\index{function, reasons for}

It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide
a program into functions.  There are several reasons:

\begin{itemize}

\item Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group
of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.

\item Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive
code.  Later, if you make a change, you only have
to make it in one place.

\item Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the
parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.

\item Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs.
Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.

\end{itemize}


\section{Importing with {\tt from}}

Python provides two ways to import modules; we have already seen one:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import math
>>> print math
<module 'math' (built-in)>
>>> print math.pi
3.14159265359
\end{verbatim}
%
If you import {\tt math}, you get a module object named {\tt math}.
The module object contains constants like {\tt pi} and functions
like {\tt sin} and {\tt exp}.

But if you try to access {\tt pi} directly, you get an error.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print pi
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'pi' is not defined
\end{verbatim}
%
As an alternative, you can import an object from a module like this:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from math import pi
\end{verbatim}
%
Now you can access {\tt pi} directly, without dot notation.
\index{dot notation}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print pi
3.14159265359
\end{verbatim}
%
Or you can use the star operator to import {\it everything} from the
module:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from math import *
>>> cos(pi)
-1.0
\end{verbatim}

The advantage of importing everything from the math module is that your
code can be more concise.  The disadvantage is that there might be
conflicts between names defined in different modules, or between
a name from a module and one of your variables.


\section{Debugging}
\label{editor}
\index{debugging}

If you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might
run into problems with spaces and tabs.  The best way to avoid
these problems is to use spaces exclusively (no tabs).  Most text
editors that know about Python do this by default, but some
don't.
\index{whitespace}

Tabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them
hard to debug, so try to find an editor that manages indentation
for you.

Also, don't forget to save your program before you run it.  Some
development environments do this automatically, but some don't.
In that case the program you are looking at in the text editor
is not the same as the program you are running.

Debugging can take a long time if you keep running the same,
incorrect, program over and over!

Make sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running.
If you're not sure, put something like \verb"print 'hello'" at the
beginning of the program and run it again.  If you don't see
\verb"hello", you're not running the right program!

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
\index{len function}
\index{function!len}

Python provides a built-in function called {\tt len} that
returns the length of a string, so the value of \verb"len('allen')" is 5.

Write a function named \verb"right_justify" that takes a string
named {\tt s} as a parameter and prints the string with enough
leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70
of the display.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> right_justify('allen')
                                                                 allen
\end{verbatim}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\index{function object}
\index{object!function}

A function object is a value you can assign to a variable
or pass as an argument.  For example, \verb"do_twice" is a function
that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:

\begin{verbatim}
def do_twice(f):
    f()
    f()
\end{verbatim}

Here's an example that uses \verb"do_twice" to call a function
named \verb"print_spam" twice.

\begin{verbatim}
def print_spam():
    print 'spam'

do_twice(print_spam)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Type this example into a script and test it.

\item Modify \verb"do_twice" so that it takes two arguments, a
function object and a value, and calls the function twice,
passing the value as an argument.

\item Write a more general version of \verb"print_spam", called
\verb"print_twice", that takes a string as a parameter and prints
it twice.

\item Use the modified version of \verb"do_twice" to call
\verb"print_twice" twice, passing \verb"'spam'" as an argument.

\item Define a new function called 
\verb"do_four" that takes a function object and a value
and calls the function four times, passing the value
as a parameter.  There should be only
two statements in the body of this function, not four.

\end{enumerate}

Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/do_four.py}.

\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}

This exercise can be
done using only the statements and other features we have learned so
far.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
\index{grid}

\begin{verbatim}
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
\end{verbatim}
%
Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print
a comma-separated sequence:

\begin{verbatim}
print '+', '-'
\end{verbatim}
%
If the sequence ends with a comma, Python leaves the line unfinished,
so the value printed next appears on the same line.

\begin{verbatim}
print '+', 
print '-'
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of these statements is \verb"'+ -'".

A {\tt print} statement all by itself ends the current line and
goes to the next line.

\item Write a function that draws a similar grid
with four rows and four columns.

\end{enumerate}

Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/grid.py}.

\chapter{Case study: interface design}
\label{turtlechap}

Code examples from this chapter are available from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/polygon.py}.


\section{TurtleWorld}
\index{TurtleWorld}
\index{Swampy}

To accompany this book, I have written a package called Swampy.
You can download Swampy from \url{http://thinkpython.com/swampy};
follow the instructions there to install Swampy on your system.

A {\bf package} is a collection of modules; one of the modules in
Swampy is {\tt TurtleWorld}, which provides a set of functions for
drawing lines by steering turtles around the screen.
\index{package}

If Swampy is installed as a package on your system, you can import
{\tt TurtleWorld} like this:

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.TurtleWorld import *
\end{verbatim}

If you downloaded the Swampy modules but did not install them as a
package, you can either work in the directory that contains the Swampy
files, or add that directory to Python's search path.  Then you can import
{\tt TurtleWorld} like this:

\begin{verbatim}
from TurtleWorld import *
\end{verbatim}

The details of the installation process and setting Python's search
path depend on your system, so rather than include those details here,
I will try to maintain current information for several systems
at \url{http://thinkpython.com/swampy}

Create a file named {\tt mypolygon.py} and type in the following
code:

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.TurtleWorld import *

world = TurtleWorld()
bob = Turtle()
print bob

wait_for_user()
\end{verbatim}
%
The first line imports everything from the {\tt TurtleWorld} module
in the {\tt swampy} package.
\index{import statement}
\index{statement!import}

The next lines create a TurtleWorld assigned to {\tt world} and
a Turtle assigned to {\tt bob}.  Printing {\tt bob} yields something
like:

\begin{verbatim}
<TurtleWorld.Turtle instance at 0xb7bfbf4c>
\end{verbatim}
%
This means that {\tt bob} refers to
an {\bf instance} of a Turtle
as defined in module {\tt TurtleWorld}.  In this context,
``instance'' means a member of a set;
this Turtle is one of the set of possible Turtles.
\index{instance}

\verb"wait_for_user" tells TurtleWorld to wait for the user
to do something, although in this case there's not much for
the user to do except close the window.

TurtleWorld provides several
turtle-steering functions: {\tt fd} and {\tt bk} for
forward and backward, and {\tt lt} and {\tt rt} for left and
right turns.  Also, each Turtle is holding a pen, which is
either down or up; if the pen is down, the Turtle leaves
a trail when it moves.  The functions {\tt pu} and {\tt pd}
stand for ``pen up'' and ``pen down.''

To draw a right angle, add these lines to the program
(after creating {\tt bob} and before calling \verb"wait_for_user"):

\begin{verbatim}
fd(bob, 100)
lt(bob)
fd(bob, 100)
\end{verbatim}
%
The first line tells {\tt bob} to take 100 steps
forward.  The second line tells him to turn left.

When you run this program, you should see {\tt bob} move east and then
north, leaving two line segments behind.

Now modify the program to draw a square.  Don't go on until
you've got it working!

%\newpage

\section{Simple repetition}
\label{repetition}
\index{repetition}

Chances are you wrote something like this (leaving out the code
that creates TurtleWorld and waits for the user):

\begin{verbatim}
fd(bob, 100)
lt(bob)

fd(bob, 100)
lt(bob)

fd(bob, 100)
lt(bob)

fd(bob, 100)
\end{verbatim}
%
We can do the same thing more concisely with a {\tt for} statement.
Add this example to {\tt mypolygon.py} and run it again:
\index{for loop}
\index{loop!for}
\index{statement!for}

\begin{verbatim}
for i in range(4):
    print 'Hello!'
\end{verbatim}
%
You should see something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
\end{verbatim}
%
This is the simplest use of the {\tt for} statement; we will see
more later.  But that should be enough to let you rewrite your
square-drawing program.  Don't go on until you do.

Here is a {\tt for} statement that draws a square:

\begin{verbatim}
for i in range(4):
    fd(bob, 100)
    lt(bob)
\end{verbatim}
%
The syntax of a {\tt for} statement is similar to a function
definition.  It has a header that ends with a colon and an indented
body.  The body can contain any number of statements.
\index{loop}

A {\tt for} statement is sometimes called a {\bf loop} because
the flow of execution runs through the body and then loops back
to the top.  In this case, it runs the body four times.

This version is actually a little different from the previous
square-drawing code because it makes another turn after
drawing the last side of the square.  The extra turn takes a little
more time, but it simplifies the code if we do the same thing
every time through the loop.  This version also has the effect
of leaving the turtle back in the starting position, facing in
the starting direction.

\section{Exercises}

The following is a series of exercises using TurtleWorld.  They
are meant to be fun, but they have a point, too.  While you are
working on them, think about what the point is.

The following sections have solutions to the exercises, so
don't look until you have finished (or at least tried).

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a function called {\tt square} that takes a parameter
named {\tt t}, which is a turtle.  It should use the turtle to draw
a square.

Write a function call that passes {\tt bob} as an argument to
{\tt square}, and then run the program again.

\item Add another parameter, named {\tt length}, to {\tt square}.
Modify the body so length of the sides is {\tt length}, and then
modify the function call to provide a second argument.  Run the
program again.  Test your program with a range of values for {\tt
length}.

\item The functions {\tt lt} and {\tt rt} make 90-degree turns by
default, but you can provide a second argument that specifies the
number of degrees.  For example, {\tt lt(bob, 45)} turns {\tt bob} 45
degrees to the left.

Make a copy of {\tt square} and change the name to {\tt polygon}.  Add
another parameter named {\tt n} and modify the body so it draws an
n-sided regular polygon.  Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular
polygon are $360/n$ degrees.
\index{polygon function}
\index{function!polygon}

\item Write a function called {\tt circle} that takes a turtle, {\tt t},
and radius, {\tt r}, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle
by invoking {\tt polygon} with an appropriate length and number of
sides.  Test your function with a range of values of {\tt r}.
\index{circle function}
\index{function!circle}

Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that
{\tt length * n = circumference}.

Another hint: if {\tt bob} is too slow for you, you can speed
him up by changing {\tt bob.delay}, which is the time between moves,
in seconds.  {\tt bob.delay = 0.01} ought to get him moving.

% change this to world.delay

\item Make a more general version of {\tt circle} called {\tt arc}
that takes an additional parameter {\tt angle}, which determines
what fraction of a circle to draw.  {\tt angle} is in units of
degrees, so when {\tt angle=360}, {\tt arc} should draw a complete
circle.
\index{arc function}
\index{function!arc}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Encapsulation}

The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code
into a function definition and then call the function, passing
the turtle as a parameter.  Here is a solution:

\begin{verbatim}
def square(t):
    for i in range(4):
        fd(t, 100)
        lt(t)

square(bob)
\end{verbatim}
%
The innermost statements, {\tt fd} and {\tt lt} are
indented twice to show that they are inside the {\tt for} loop,
which is inside the function definition.  The next line,
{\tt square(bob)}, is flush with the left margin, so that is the
end of both the {\tt for} loop and the function definition.

Inside the function, {\tt t} refers to the same turtle {\tt bob}
refers to, so {\tt lt(t)} has the same effect as {\tt lt(bob)}.
So why not call the parameter {\tt bob}?  The idea is that {\tt t}
can be any turtle, not just {\tt bob}, so you could create
a second turtle and pass it as an argument to {\tt square}:

\begin{verbatim}
ray = Turtle()
square(ray)
\end{verbatim}
%
Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called {\bf
encapsulation}.  One of the benefits of encapsulation is that it
attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation.
Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise
to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!
\index{encapsulation}


\section{Generalization}

The next step is to add a {\tt length} parameter to {\tt square}.
Here is a solution:

\begin{verbatim}
def square(t, length):
    for i in range(4):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t)

square(bob, 100)
\end{verbatim}
%
Adding a parameter to a function is called {\bf generalization}
because it makes the function more general: in the previous
version, the square is always the same size; in this version
it can be any size.
\index{generalization}

The next step is also a generalization.  Instead of drawing
squares, {\tt polygon} draws regular polygons with any number of
sides.  Here is a solution:

\begin{verbatim}
def polygon(t, n, length):
    angle = 360.0 / n
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t, angle)

polygon(bob, 7, 70)
\end{verbatim}
%
This draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70.  If you have
more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they
are, or what order they should be in.  It is legal, and sometimes
helpful, to include the names of the parameters in the argument
list:

\begin{verbatim}
polygon(bob, n=7, length=70)
\end{verbatim}
%
These are called {\bf keyword arguments} because they include
the parameter names as ``keywords'' (not to be confused with
Python keywords like {\tt while} and {\tt def}).
\index{keyword argument}
\index{argument!keyword}

This syntax makes the program more readable.  It is also a reminder
about how arguments and parameters work: when you call a function, the
arguments are assigned to the parameters.


\section{Interface design}

The next step is to write {\tt circle}, which takes a radius,
{\tt r}, as a parameter.  Here is a simple solution that uses
{\tt polygon} to draw a 50-sided polygon:

\begin{verbatim}
def circle(t, r):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r
    n = 50
    length = circumference / n
    polygon(t, n, length)
\end{verbatim}
%
The first line computes the circumference of a circle with radius
{\tt r} using the formula $2 \pi r$.  Since we use {\tt math.pi}, we
have to import {\tt math}.  By convention, {\tt import} statements
are usually at the beginning of the script.

{\tt n} is the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle,
so {\tt length} is the length of each segment.  Thus, {\tt polygon}
draws a 50-sides polygon that approximates a circle with radius {\tt r}.

One limitation of this solution is that {\tt n} is a constant, which
means that for very big circles, the line segments are too long, and
for small circles, we waste time drawing very small segments.  One
solution would be to generalize the function by taking {\tt n} as
a parameter.  This would give the user (whoever calls {\tt circle})
more control, but the interface would be less clean.
\index{interface}

The {\bf interface} of a function is a summary of how it is used: what
are the parameters?  What does the function do?  And what is the return
value?  An interface is ``clean'' if it is ``as simple as
possible, but not simpler. (Einstein)''
\index{Einstein, Albert}

In this example, {\tt r} belongs in the interface because it
specifies the circle to be drawn.  {\tt n} is less appropriate
because it pertains to the details of {\em how} the circle should
be rendered.

Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better
to choose an appropriate value of {\tt n}
depending on {\tt circumference}:

\begin{verbatim}
def circle(t, r):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r
    n = int(circumference / 3) + 1
    length = circumference / n
    polygon(t, n, length)
\end{verbatim}
%
Now the number of segments is (approximately) {\tt circumference/3},
so the length of each segment is (approximately) 3, which is small
enough that the circles look good, but big enough to be efficient,
and appropriate for any size circle.


\section{Refactoring}
\label{refactoring}
\index{refactoring}

When I wrote {\tt circle}, I was able to re-use {\tt polygon}
because a many-sided polygon is a good approximation of a circle.
But {\tt arc} is not as cooperative; we can't use {\tt polygon}
or {\tt circle} to draw an arc.

One alternative is to start with a copy
of {\tt polygon} and transform it into {\tt arc}.  The result
might look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
def arc(t, r, angle):
    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360
    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1
    step_length = arc_length / n
    step_angle = float(angle) / n
    
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, step_length)
        lt(t, step_angle)
\end{verbatim}
%
The second half of this function looks like {\tt polygon}, but we
can't re-use {\tt polygon} without changing the interface.  We could
generalize {\tt polygon} to take an angle as a third argument,
but then {\tt polygon} would no longer be an appropriate name!
Instead, let's call the more general function {\tt polyline}:

\begin{verbatim}
def polyline(t, n, length, angle):
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t, angle)
\end{verbatim}
%
Now we can rewrite {\tt polygon} and {\tt arc} to use {\tt polyline}:

\begin{verbatim}
def polygon(t, n, length):
    angle = 360.0 / n
    polyline(t, n, length, angle)

def arc(t, r, angle):
    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360
    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1
    step_length = arc_length / n
    step_angle = float(angle) / n
    polyline(t, n, step_length, step_angle)
\end{verbatim}
%
Finally, we can rewrite {\tt circle} to use {\tt arc}:

\begin{verbatim}
def circle(t, r):
    arc(t, r, 360)
\end{verbatim}
%
This process---rearranging a program to improve function
interfaces and facilitate code re-use---is called {\bf refactoring}.
In this case, we noticed that there was similar code in {\tt arc} and
{\tt polygon}, so we ``factored it out'' into {\tt polyline}.
\index{refactoring}

If we had planned ahead, we might have written {\tt polyline} first
and avoided refactoring, but often you don't know enough at the
beginning of a project to design all the interfaces.  Once you start
coding, you understand the problem better.  Sometimes refactoring is a
sign that you have learned something.


\section{A development plan}
\index{development plan!encapsulation and generalization}

A {\bf development plan} is a process for writing programs.
The process we used
in this case study is ``encapsulation and
generalization.''  The steps of this process are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.

\item Once you get the program working, encapsulate it in a function
and give it a name.

\item Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.

\item Repeat steps 1--3 until you have a set of working functions.
Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).

\item Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring.
For example, if you have similar code in several places, consider
factoring it into an appropriately general function.

\end{enumerate}

This process has some drawbacks---we will see alternatives later---but
it can be useful if you don't know ahead of time how to divide the
program into functions.  This approach lets you design as you go
along.


\section{docstring}
\label{docstring}
\index{docstring}

A {\bf docstring} is a string at the beginning of a function that
explains the interface (``doc'' is short for ``documentation'').  Here
is an example:

\begin{verbatim}
def polyline(t, n, length, angle):
    """Draws n line segments with the given length and
    angle (in degrees) between them.  t is a turtle.
    """    
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t, angle)
\end{verbatim}
%
This docstring is a triple-quoted string, also known
as a multiline string because the triple quotes allow the string
to span more than one line.
\index{quotation mark}
\index{triple-quoted string}
\index{string!triple-quoted}
\index{multiline string}
\index{string!multiline}

It is terse, but it contains the essential information
someone would need to use this function.  It explains concisely what
the function does (without getting into the details of how it does
it).  It explains what effect each parameter has on the behavior of
the function and what type each parameter should be (if it is not
obvious).

Writing this kind of documentation is an important part of interface
design.  A well-designed interface should be simple to explain;
if you are having a hard time explaining one of your functions,
that might be a sign that the interface could be improved.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}
\index{interface}

An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller.
The caller agrees to provide certain parameters and the function
agrees to do certain work.

For example, {\tt polyline} requires four arguments: {\tt t} has to be
a Turtle; {\tt n} is the number of line segments, so it has to be an
integer; {\tt length} should be a positive number; and {\tt
  angle} has to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees.

These requirements are called {\bf preconditions} because they
are supposed to be true before the function starts executing.
Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are
{\bf postconditions}.  Postconditions include the intended
effect of the function (like drawing line segments) and any
side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes
in the World).
\index{precondition}
\index{postcondition}

Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller.  If the caller
violates a (properly documented!) precondition and the function
doesn't work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not the function.

% Removing this because we haven't seen conditionals yet!
%However, for purposes of debugging it is often a good idea for
%functions to check their preconditions rather than assume they are
%true.  If every function checks its preconditions before starting,
%then if something goes wrong, you will know which function to blame.

the turtle ends up a few units away from the correct

\chapter{Conditionals and recursion}

\section{Modulus operator}
\index{modulus operator}
\index{operator!modulus}

The {\bf modulus operator} works on integers and yields the remainder
when the first operand is divided by the second.  In Python, the
modulus operator is a percent sign (\verb"%").  The syntax is the same
as for other operators:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> quotient = 7 / 3
>>> print quotient
2
>>> remainder = 7 % 3
>>> print remainder
1
\end{verbatim}
%
So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.

The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful.  For
example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another---if
{\tt x \% y} is zero, then {\tt x} is divisible by {\tt y}.
\index{divisibility}

Also, you can extract the right-most digit
or digits from a number.  For example, {\tt x \% 10} yields the
right-most digit of {\tt x} (in base 10).  Similarly {\tt x \% 100}
yields the last two digits.


\section{Boolean expressions}
\index{boolean expression}
\index{expression!boolean}
\index{logical operator}
\index{operator!logical}

A {\bf boolean expression} is an expression that is either true
or false.  The following examples use the 
operator {\tt ==}, which compares two operands and produces
{\tt True} if they are equal and {\tt False} otherwise:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 5 == 6
False
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt True} and {\tt False} are special
values that belong to the type {\tt bool}; they are not strings:
\index{True special value}
\index{False special value}
\index{special value!True}
\index{special value!False}
\index{bool type}
\index{type!bool}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(True)
<type 'bool'>
>>> type(False)
<type 'bool'>
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt ==} operator is one of the {\bf relational operators}; the
others are:

\begin{verbatim}
      x != y               # x is not equal to y
      x > y                # x is greater than y
      x < y                # x is less than y
      x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
      x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y
\end{verbatim}
%
Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python
symbols are different from the mathematical symbols.  A common error
is to use a single equal sign ({\tt =}) instead of a double equal sign
({\tt ==}).  Remember that {\tt =} is an assignment operator and
{\tt ==} is a relational operator.   There is no such thing as
{\tt =<} or {\tt =>}.
\index{relational operator}
\index{operator!relational}


\section {Logical operators}
\index{logical operator}
\index{operator!logical}

There are three {\bf logical operators}: {\tt and}, {\tt
or}, and {\tt not}.  The semantics (meaning) of these operators is
similar to their meaning in English.  For example,
{\tt x > 0 and x < 10} is true only if {\tt x} is greater than 0
{\em and} less than 10.
\index{and operator}
\index{or operator}
\index{not operator}
\index{operator!and}
\index{operator!or}
\index{operator!not}

{\tt n\%2 == 0 or n\%3 == 0} is true if {\em either} of the conditions
is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 {\em or} 3.

Finally, the {\tt not} operator negates a boolean
expression, so {\tt not (x > y)} is true if {\tt x > y} is false,
that is, if {\tt x} is less than or equal to {\tt y}.

Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be
boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict.
Any nonzero number is interpreted as ``true.''

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 17 and True
True
\end{verbatim}
%
This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to
it that might be confusing.  You might want to avoid it (unless
you know what you are doing).


\section{Conditional execution}
\label{conditional.execution}

\index{conditional statement}
\index{statement!conditional}
\index{if statement}
\index{statement!if}
\index{conditional execution}
In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability
to check conditions and change the behavior of the program
accordingly.  {\bf Conditional statements} give us this ability.  The
simplest form is the {\tt if} statement:

\begin{verbatim}
if x > 0:
    print 'x is positive'
\end{verbatim}
%
The boolean expression after {\tt if} is
called the {\bf condition}.  If it is true, then the indented
statement gets executed.  If not, nothing happens.
\index{condition}
\index{compound statement}
\index{statement!compound}

{\tt if} statements have the same structure as function definitions:
a header followed by an indented body.  Statements like this are
called {\bf compound statements}.

There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in
the body, but there has to be at least one.
Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually
as a place keeper for code you haven't written yet).  In that
case, you can use the {\tt pass} statement, which does nothing.
\index{pass statement}
\index{statement!pass}

\begin{verbatim}
if x < 0:
    pass          # need to handle negative values!
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Alternative execution}
\label{alternative.execution}
\index{alternative execution}
\index{else keyword}
\index{keyword!else}

A second form of the {\tt if} statement is {\bf alternative execution},
in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines
which one gets executed.  The syntax looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
if x%2 == 0:
    print 'x is even'
else:
    print 'x is odd'
\end{verbatim}
%
If the remainder when {\tt x} is divided by 2 is 0, then we
know that {\tt x} is even, and the program displays a message to that
effect.  If the condition is false, the second set of statements is
executed.  Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of
the alternatives will be executed.  The alternatives are called
{\bf branches}, because they are branches in the flow of execution.
\index{branch}



\section{Chained conditionals}
\index{chained conditional}
\index{conditional!chained}

Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than
two branches.  One way to express a computation like that is a {\bf
chained conditional}:

\begin{verbatim}
if x < y:
    print 'x is less than y'
elif x > y:
    print 'x is greater than y'
else:
    print 'x and y are equal'
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt elif} is an abbreviation of ``else if.''  Again, exactly one
branch will be executed.  There is no limit on the number of {\tt
elif} statements.  If there is an {\tt else} clause, it has to be
at the end, but there doesn't have to be one.
\index{elif keyword}
\index{keyword!elif}


\begin{verbatim}
if choice == 'a':
    draw_a()
elif choice == 'b':
    draw_b()
elif choice == 'c':
    draw_c()
\end{verbatim}
%
Each condition is checked in order.  If the first is false,
the next is checked, and so on.  If one of them is
true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement
ends.  Even if more than one condition is true, only the
first true branch executes.  


\section{Nested conditionals}
\index{nested conditional}
\index{conditional!nested}

One conditional can also be nested within another.  We could have
written the trichotomy example like this:

\begin{verbatim}
if x == y:
    print 'x and y are equal'
else:
    if x < y:
        print 'x is less than y'
    else:
        print 'x is greater than y'
\end{verbatim}
%
The outer conditional contains two branches.  The
first branch contains a simple statement.  The second branch
contains another {\tt if} statement, which has two branches of its
own.  Those two branches are both simple statements,
although they could have been conditional statements as well.

Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure
apparent, {\bf nested conditionals} become difficult to read very
quickly. In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you can.

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional
statements.  For example, we can rewrite the following code using a
single conditional:

\begin{verbatim}
if 0 < x:
    if x < 10:
        print 'x is a positive single-digit number.'
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt print} statement is executed only if we make it past both
conditionals, so we can get the same effect with the {\tt and} operator:

\begin{verbatim}
if 0 < x and x < 10:
    print 'x is a positive single-digit number.'
\end{verbatim}


\section{Recursion}
\label{recursion}
\index{recursion}

It is legal for one function to call another;
it is also legal for a function to call itself.  It may not be obvious
why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most
magical things a program can do.
For example, look at the following function:

\begin{verbatim}
def countdown(n):
    if n <= 0:
        print 'Blastoff!'
    else:
        print n
        countdown(n-1)
\end{verbatim}
%
If {\tt n} is 0 or negative, it outputs the word, ``Blastoff!''
Otherwise, it outputs {\tt n} and then calls a function named {\tt
countdown}---itself---passing {\tt n-1} as an argument.

What happens if we call this function like this?

\begin{verbatim}
>>> countdown(3)
\end{verbatim}
%
The execution of {\tt countdown} begins with {\tt n=3}, and since
{\tt n} is greater than 0, it outputs the value 3, and then calls itself...

\begin{quote}
The execution of {\tt countdown} begins with {\tt n=2}, and since
{\tt n} is greater than 0, it outputs the value 2, and then calls itself...

\begin{quote}
The execution of {\tt countdown} begins with {\tt n=1}, and since
{\tt n} is greater than 0, it outputs the value 1, and then calls itself...

\begin{quote}
The execution of {\tt countdown} begins with {\tt n=0}, and since {\tt
n} is not greater than 0, it outputs the word, ``Blastoff!'' and then
returns.
\end{quote}

The {\tt countdown} that got {\tt n=1} returns.
\end{quote}

The {\tt countdown} that got {\tt n=2} returns.
\end{quote}

The {\tt countdown} that got {\tt n=3} returns.

And then you're back in \verb"__main__".  So, the
total output looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
3
2
1
Blastoff!
\end{verbatim}
%
A function that calls itself is {\bf recursive}; the process is
called {\bf recursion}.
\index{recursion}
\index{function!recursive}

As another example, we can write a function that prints a
string {\tt n} times.

\begin{verbatim}
def print_n(s, n):
    if n <= 0:
        return
    print s
    print_n(s, n-1)
\end{verbatim}
%
If {\tt n <= 0} the {\tt return} statement exits the function.  The
flow of execution immediately returns to the caller, and the remaining
lines of the function are not executed.
\index{return statement}
\index{statement!return}

The rest of the function is similar to {\tt countdown}: if {\tt n} is
greater than 0, it displays {\tt s} and then calls itself to display
{\tt s} $n-1$ additional times.  So the number of lines of output
is {\tt 1 + (n - 1)}, which adds up to
{\tt n}.

For simple examples like this, it is probably easier to use a {\tt
for} loop.  But we will see examples later that are hard to write
with a {\tt for} loop and easy to write with recursion, so it is
good to start early.



\section{Stack diagrams for recursive functions}
\label{recursive.stack}
\index{stack diagram}
\index{function frame}
\index{frame}

In Section~\ref{stackdiagram}, we used a stack diagram to represent
the state of a program during a function call.  The same kind of
diagram can help interpret a recursive function.

Every time a function gets called, Python creates a new function
frame, which contains the function's local variables and parameters.
For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on the
stack at the same time.

Figure~\ref{fig.stack2} shows a stack diagram for {\tt countdown} called with
{\tt n = 3}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/stack2.pdf}}
\caption{Stack diagram.}
\label{fig.stack2}
\end{figure}


As usual, the top of the stack is the frame for \verb"__main__".
It is empty because we did not create any variables in 
\verb"__main__" or pass any arguments to it.
\index{base case}
\index{recursion!base case}

The four {\tt countdown} frames have different values for the
parameter {\tt n}.  The bottom of the stack, where {\tt n=0}, is
called the {\bf base case}.  It does not make a recursive call, so
there are no more frames.

\begin{exercise}
Draw a stack diagram for \verb"print_n" called with
\verb"s = 'Hello'" and {\tt n=2}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Write a function called \verb"do_n" that takes a function
object and a number, {\tt n}, as arguments, and that calls
the given function {\tt n} times.
\end{exercise}



\section{Infinite recursion}
\index{infinite recursion}
\index{recursion!infinite}
\index{runtime error}
\index{error!runtime}
\index{traceback}

If a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making
recursive calls forever, and the program never terminates.  This is
known as {\bf infinite recursion}, and it is generally not
a good idea.  Here is a minimal program with an infinite recursion:

\begin{verbatim}
def recurse():
    recurse()
\end{verbatim}
%
In most programming environments, a program with infinite recursion
does not really run forever.  Python reports an error
message when the maximum recursion depth is reached:
\index{exception!RuntimeError}
\index{RuntimeError}

\begin{verbatim}
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse
                  .   
                  .
                  .
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded
\end{verbatim}
%
This traceback is a little bigger than the one we saw in the
previous chapter.  When the error occurs, there are 1000
{\tt recurse} frames on the stack!


\section{Keyboard input}
\index{keyboard input}

The programs we have written so far are a bit rude in the sense that
they accept no input from the user.  They just do the same thing every
time.

Python 2 provides a built-in function called \verb"raw_input" that gets
input from the keyboard.  In Python 3, it is called
  {\tt input}.  When this function is called, the program stops and
waits for the user to type something.  When the user presses {\sf
  Return} or {\sf Enter}, the program resumes and \verb"raw_input"
returns what the user typed as a string.
\index{Python 3}
\index{raw\_input function}
\index{function!raw\_input}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> input = raw_input()
What are you waiting for?
>>> print input
What are you waiting for?
\end{verbatim}
%
Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a
prompt telling the user what to input.  \verb"raw_input" can take a
prompt as an argument:
\index{prompt}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> name = raw_input('What...is your name?\n')
What...is your name?
Arthur, King of the Britons!
>>> print name
Arthur, King of the Britons!
\end{verbatim}
%
The sequence \verb"\n" at the end of the prompt represents a {\bf newline},
which is a special character that causes a line break.
That's why the user's input appears below the prompt.
\index{newline}

If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert
the return value to {\tt int}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n'
>>> speed = raw_input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
17
>>> int(speed)
17
\end{verbatim}
%
But if the user types something other than a string of digits,
you get an error:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> speed = raw_input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?
>>> int(speed)
ValueError: invalid literal for int()
\end{verbatim}
%
We will see how to handle this kind of error later.
\index{ValueError}
\index{exception!ValueError}


\section{Debugging}
\label{whitespace}
\index{debugging}
\index{traceback}

The traceback Python displays when an error occurs contains
a lot of information, but it can be overwhelming, especially
when there are many frames on the stack.  The most
useful parts are usually:

\begin{itemize}

\item What kind of error it was, and

\item Where it occurred.

\end{itemize}

Syntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few
gotchas.  Whitespace errors can be tricky because spaces and
tabs are invisible and we are used to ignoring them.
\index{whitespace}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> x = 5
>>>  y = 6
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    y = 6
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
\end{verbatim}
%
In this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by
one space.  But the error message points to {\tt y}, which is
misleading.  In general, error messages indicate where the problem was
discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code,
sometimes on a previous line.
\index{error!runtime}
\index{runtime error}

The same is true of runtime errors.  

Suppose you are trying
to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels.  The formula
is $SNR_{db} = 10 \log_{10} (P_{signal} / P_{noise})$.  In Python,
you might write something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
import math
signal_power = 9
noise_power = 10
ratio = signal_power / noise_power
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
print decibels
\end{verbatim}
%
But when you run it in Python 2, you get an error message.
\index{exception!OverflowError}
\index{OverflowError}

\begin{verbatim}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "snr.py", line 5, in ?
    decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
OverflowError: math range error
\end{verbatim}
%
The error message indicates line 5, but there is nothing
wrong with that line.  To find the real error, it might be
useful to print the value of {\tt ratio}, which turns out to
be 0.  The problem is in line 4, because dividing two integers
does floor division.  The solution is to represent signal power
and noise power with floating-point values.
\index{floor division}
\index{division!floor}

In general, error messages tell you where the problem was discovered, 
but that is often not where it was caused.

In Python 3, this example does not cause an error; the division operator
performs floating-point division even with integer operands.

\section{Exercises}

Fermat's Last Theorem says that there are no integers
$a$, $b$, and $c$ such that

\[ a^n + b^n = c^n \]
%
for any values of $n$ greater than 2.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a function named \verb"check_fermat" that takes four
parameters---{\tt a}, {\tt b}, {\tt c} and {\tt n}---and
that checks to see if Fermat's theorem holds.  If
$n$ is greater than 2 and it turns out to be true that 

\[a^n + b^n = c^n \]
%
the program should print, ``Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!''
Otherwise the program should print, ``No, that doesn't work.''

\item Write a function that prompts the user to input values
for {\tt a}, {\tt b}, {\tt c} and {\tt n}, converts them to
integers, and uses \verb"check_fermat" to check whether they
violate Fermat's theorem.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
\index{triangle}

If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange
them in a triangle.  For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches
long and the other two are one inch long, it is clear that you will
not be able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle.  For any
three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form
a triangle:

\begin{quotation}
If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other
  two, then you cannot form a triangle.  Otherwise, you
  can.  (If the sum of two lengths equals the third, they form
    what is called a ``degenerate'' triangle.)
\end{quotation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a function named \verb"is_triangle" that takes three
  integers as arguments, and that prints either ``Yes'' or ``No,'' depending
  on whether you can or cannot form a triangle from sticks with the
  given lengths.

\item Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick
  lengths, converts them to integers, and uses \verb"is_triangle" to
  check whether sticks with the given lengths can form a triangle.

\end{enumerate}

The following exercises use TurtleWorld from Chapter~\ref{turtlechap}:

        return
    angle = 50

a length as parameters, and that uses the turtle to draw a Koch
curve with the given length.

\chapter{Fruitful functions}
\label{fruitchap}

\section{Return values}
\index{return value}

Some of the built-in functions we have used, such as the math
functions, produce results.  Calling the function generates a
value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an
expression.

\begin{verbatim}
e = math.exp(1.0)
height = radius * math.sin(radians)
\end{verbatim}
%
All of the functions we have written so far are void; they print
something or move turtles around, but their return value is {\tt
None}.

In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions.
The first example is {\tt area}, which returns the area of a circle
with the given radius:

\begin{verbatim}
def area(radius):
    temp = math.pi * radius**2
    return temp
\end{verbatim}
%
We have seen the {\tt return} statement before, but in a fruitful
function the {\tt return} statement includes
an expression.  This statement means: ``Return immediately from
this function and use the following expression as a return value.''
The expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could
have written this function more concisely:
\index{return statement}
\index{statement!return}

\begin{verbatim}
def area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius**2
\end{verbatim}
%
On the other hand, {\bf temporary variables} like {\tt temp} often make
debugging easier.
\index{temporary variable}
\index{variable!temporary}

Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each
branch of a conditional:

\begin{verbatim}
def absolute_value(x):
    if x < 0:
        return -x
    else:
        return x
\end{verbatim}
%
Since these {\tt return} statements are in an alternative conditional,
only one will be executed.

As soon as a return statement executes, the function
terminates without executing any subsequent statements.
Code that appears after a {\tt return} statement, or any other place
the flow of execution can never reach, is called {\bf dead code}.
\index{dead code}

In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure
that every possible path through the program hits a
{\tt return} statement.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
def absolute_value(x):
    if x < 0:
        return -x
    if x > 0:
        return x
\end{verbatim}
%
This function is incorrect because if {\tt x} happens to be 0,
neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a
{\tt return} statement.  If the flow of execution gets to the end
of a function, the return value is {\tt None}, which is not
the absolute value of 0.
\index{None special value}
\index{special value!None}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print absolute_value(0)
None
\end{verbatim}
%
By the way, Python provides a built-in function called 
{\tt abs} that computes absolute values.
\index{abs function}
\index{function!abs}

\begin{exercise}
\index{compare function}
\index{function!compare}

Write a {\tt compare} function
that returns {\tt 1} if {\tt x > y},
{\tt 0} if {\tt x == y}, and {\tt -1} if {\tt x < y}.
\end{exercise}


\section{Incremental development}
\label{incremental.development}
\index{development plan!incremental}

As you write larger functions, you might find yourself
spending more time debugging.

To deal with increasingly complex programs,
you might want to try a process called
{\bf incremental development}.  The goal of incremental development
is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only
a small amount of code at a time.
\index{testing!incremental development}
\index{Pythagorean theorem}

As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two
points, given by the coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$.
By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:

\begin{displaymath}
\mathrm{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\end{displaymath}
%
The first step is to consider what a {\tt distance} function should
look like in Python.  In other words, what are the inputs (parameters)
and what is the output (return value)?

In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent
using four numbers.  The return value is the distance, which is
a floating-point value.

Already you can write an outline of the function:

\begin{verbatim}
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return 0.0
\end{verbatim}
%
Obviously, this version doesn't compute distances; it always returns
zero.  But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that
you can test it before you make it more complicated.

To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
0.0
\end{verbatim}
%
I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the
vertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5
(the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle). When testing a function, it is
useful to know the right answer.
\index{testing!knowing the answer}

At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically
correct, and we can start adding code to the body.
A reasonable next step is to find the differences
$x_2 - x_1$ and $y_2 - y_1$.  The next version stores those values in
temporary variables and prints them.

\begin{verbatim}
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    print 'dx is', dx
    print 'dy is', dy
    return 0.0
\end{verbatim}
%
If the function is working, it should display \verb"'dx is 3'" and {\tt
'dy is 4'}.  If so, we know that the function is getting the right
arguments and performing the first computation correctly.  If not,
there are only a few lines to check.

Next we compute the sum of squares of {\tt dx} and {\tt dy}:

\begin{verbatim}
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    print 'dsquared is: ', dsquared
    return 0.0
\end{verbatim}
%
Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output
(which should be 25).
Finally, you can use {\tt math.sqrt} to compute and return the result:
\index{sqrt}
\index{function!sqrt}

\begin{verbatim}
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)
    return result
\end{verbatim}
%
If that works correctly, you are done.  Otherwise, you might
want to print the value of {\tt result} before the return
statement.

The final version of the function doesn't display anything when it
runs; it only returns a value.  The {\tt print} statements we wrote
are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you
should remove them.  Code like that is called {\bf scaffolding}
because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the
final product.
\index{scaffolding}

When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a
time.  As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing
and debugging bigger chunks.  Either way, incremental development
can save you a lot of debugging time.

The key aspects of the process are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. 
At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea
where it is.

\item Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so you can
display and check them.

\item Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of
the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound
expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to
read.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
\index{hypotenuse}

Use incremental development to write a function
called {\tt hypotenuse} that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle given the lengths of the two legs as arguments.
Record each stage of the development process as you go.
\end{exercise}


\section{Composition}
\index{composition}
\index{function composition}

As you should expect by now, you can call one function from
within another.  This ability is called {\bf composition}.

As an example, we'll write a function that takes two points,
the center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes
the area of the circle.

Assume that the center point is stored in the variables {\tt xc} and
{\tt yc}, and the perimeter point is in {\tt xp} and {\tt yp}. The
first step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance
between the two points.  We just wrote a function, {\tt
distance}, that does that:

\begin{verbatim}
radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
\end{verbatim}
%
The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius;
we just wrote that, too:

\begin{verbatim}
result = area(radius)
\end{verbatim}
%
Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get:
\index{encapsulation}

\begin{verbatim}
def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
    result = area(radius)
    return result
\end{verbatim}
%
The temporary variables {\tt radius} and {\tt result} are useful for
development and debugging, but once the program is working, we can
make it more concise by composing the function calls:

\begin{verbatim}
def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Boolean functions}
\label{boolean}

Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding
complicated tests inside functions.  \index{boolean function}
For example:

\begin{verbatim}
def is_divisible(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
\end{verbatim}
%
It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no
questions; \verb"is_divisible" returns either {\tt True} or {\tt False}
to indicate whether {\tt x} is divisible by {\tt y}.

Here is an example:

\begin{verbatim}
>>>   is_divisible(6, 4)
False
>>>   is_divisible(6, 3)
True
\end{verbatim}
%
The result of the {\tt ==} operator is a boolean, so we can write the
function more concisely by returning it directly:

\begin{verbatim}
def is_divisible(x, y):
    return x % y == 0
\end{verbatim}
%
Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:
\index{conditional statement}
\index{statement!conditional}

\begin{verbatim}
if is_divisible(x, y):
    print 'x is divisible by y'
\end{verbatim}
%
It might be tempting to write something like:

\begin{verbatim}
if is_divisible(x, y) == True:
    print 'x is divisible by y'
\end{verbatim}
%
But the extra comparison is unnecessary.

\begin{exercise}

Write a function \verb"is_between(x, y, z)" that
returns {\tt True} if $x \le y \le z$ or {\tt False} otherwise.

\end{exercise}


\section{More recursion}
\label{more.recursion}
\index{recursion}
\index{Turing complete language}
\index{language!Turing complete}
\index{Turing, Alan}
\index{Turing Thesis}

We have only covered a small subset of Python, but you might
be interested to know that this subset is a {\em complete}
programming language, which means that anything that can be
computed can be expressed in this language.  Any program ever written
could be rewritten using only the language features you have learned
so far (actually, you would need a few commands to control devices
like the keyboard, mouse, disks, etc., but that's all).

Proving that claim is a nontrivial exercise first accomplished by Alan
Turing, one of the first computer scientists (some would argue that he
was a mathematician, but a lot of early computer scientists started as
mathematicians).  Accordingly, it is known as the Turing Thesis.
For a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis,
I recommend Michael Sipser's book {\em Introduction to the
Theory of Computation}.

To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned
so far, we'll evaluate a few recursively defined mathematical
functions.  A recursive definition is similar to a circular
definition, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to
the thing being defined.  A truly circular definition is not very
useful:

\begin{description}

\item[vorpal:] An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal.
\index{vorpal}
\index{circular definition}
\index{definition!circular}

\end{description}

If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On
the other hand, if you looked up the definition of the factorial
function, denoted with the symbol $!$, you might get something like
this:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&  0! = 1 \\
&&  n! = n (n-1)!
\end{eqnarray*}
%
This definition says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial
of any other value, $n$, is $n$ multiplied by the factorial of $n-1$.

So $3!$ is 3 times $2!$, which is 2 times $1!$, which is 1 times
$0!$. Putting it all together, $3!$ equals 3 times 2 times 1 times 1,
which is 6.
\index{factorial function}
\index{function!factorial}
\index{recursive definition}

If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can usually
write a Python program to evaluate it. The first step is to decide
what the parameters should be.  In this case it should be clear
that {\tt factorial} takes an integer:

\begin{verbatim}
def factorial(n):
\end{verbatim}
%
If the argument happens to be 0, all we have to do is return 1:

\begin{verbatim}
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
\end{verbatim}
%
Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a
recursive call to find the factorial of $n-1$ and then multiply it by
$n$:

\begin{verbatim}
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        return result
\end{verbatim}
%
The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow of {\tt
countdown} in Section~\ref{recursion}.  If we call {\tt factorial}
with the value 3:

Since 3 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial
of {\tt n-1}...

\begin{quote}
Since 2 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of
{\tt n-1}...


  \begin{quote}
  Since 1 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial
  of {\tt n-1}...


    \begin{quote}
    Since 0 {\em is} 0, we take the first branch and return 1
    without making any more recursive calls.
    \end{quote}


  The return value (1) is multiplied by $n$, which is 1, and the
  result is returned.
  \end{quote}


The return value (1) is multiplied by $n$, which is 2, and the
result is returned.
\end{quote}


The return value (2) is multiplied by $n$, which is 3, and the result, 6,
becomes the return value of the function call that started the whole
process.
\index{stack diagram}

Figure~\ref{fig.stack3} shows what the stack diagram looks like for
this sequence of function calls.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/stack3.pdf}}
\caption{Stack diagram.}
\label{fig.stack3}
\end{figure}

The return values are shown being passed back up the stack.  In each
frame, the return value is the value of {\tt result}, which is the
product of {\tt n} and {\tt recurse}.
\index{function frame}
\index{frame}

In the last frame, the local
variables {\tt recurse} and {\tt result} do not exist, because
the branch that creates them does not execute.


\section{Leap of faith}
\index{recursion}
\index{leap of faith}

Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but
it can quickly become labyrinthine.  An
alternative is what I call the ``leap of faith.''  When you come to a
function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you {\em
assume} that the function works correctly and returns the right
result.

In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use
built-in functions.  When you call {\tt math.cos} or {\tt math.exp},
you don't examine the bodies of those functions.  You just
assume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in
functions were good programmers.

The same is true when you call one of your own functions.  For
example, in Section~\ref{boolean}, we wrote a function called 
\verb"is_divisible" that determines whether one number is divisible by
another.  Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is
correct---by examining the code and testing---we can use the function
without looking at the body again.
\index{testing!leap of faith}

The same is true of recursive programs.  When you get to the recursive
call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume
that the recursive call works (yields the correct result) and then ask
yourself, ``Assuming that I can find the factorial of $n-1$, can I
compute the factorial of $n$?''  In this case, it is clear that you
can, by multiplying by $n$.

Of course, it's a bit strange to assume that the function works
correctly when you haven't finished writing it, but that's why
it's called a leap of faith!


\section{One more example}
\label{one.more.example}

\index{fibonacci function}
\index{function!fibonacci}
After {\tt factorial}, the most common example of a recursively
defined mathematical function is {\tt fibonacci}, which has the
following definition (see
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number}):
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& \mathrm{fibonacci}(0) = 0 \\
&& \mathrm{fibonacci}(1) = 1 \\
&& \mathrm{fibonacci}(n) = \mathrm{fibonacci}(n-1) + \mathrm{fibonacci}(n-2)
\end{eqnarray*}
%
Translated into Python, it looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
def fibonacci (n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif  n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
\end{verbatim}
%
If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly
small values of $n$, your head explodes.  But according to the
leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls
work correctly, then it is clear that you get
the right result by adding them together.
\index{flow of execution}


\section{Checking types}
\label{guardian}

What happens if we call {\tt factorial} and give it 1.5 as an argument?
\index{type checking}
\index{error checking}
\index{factorial function}
\index{RuntimeError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> factorial(1.5)
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded
\end{verbatim}
%
It looks like an infinite recursion.  But how can that be?  There is a
base case---when {\tt n == 0}.  But if {\tt n} is not an integer,
we can {\em miss} the base case and recurse forever.
\index{infinite recursion}
\index{recursion!infinite}

In the first recursive call, the value of {\tt n} is 0.5.
In the next, it is -0.5.  From there, it gets smaller
(more negative), but it will never be 0.

We have two choices.  We can try to generalize the {\tt factorial}
function to work with floating-point numbers, or we can make {\tt
  factorial} check the type of its argument.  The first option is
called the gamma function and it's a
little beyond the scope of this book.  So we'll go for the second.
\index{gamma function}

We can use the built-in function {\tt isinstance} to verify the type
of the argument.  While we're at it, we can also make sure the
argument is positive:
\index{isinstance function}
\index{function!isinstance}

\begin{verbatim}
def factorial (n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        print 'Factorial is only defined for integers.'
        return None
    elif n < 0:
        print 'Factorial is not defined for negative integers.'
        return None
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
\end{verbatim}
%
The first base case handles nonintegers; the
second catches negative integers.  In both cases, the program prints
an error message and returns {\tt None} to indicate that something
went wrong:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> factorial('fred')
Factorial is only defined for integers.
None
>>> factorial(-2)
Factorial is not defined for negative integers.
None
\end{verbatim}
% 
If we get past both checks, then we know that $n$ is positive or
zero, so we can prove that the recursion terminates.
\index{guardian pattern}
\index{pattern!guardian}

This program demonstrates a pattern sometimes called a {\bf guardian}.
The first two conditionals act as guardians, protecting the code that
follows from values that might cause an error.  The guardians make it
possible to prove the correctness of the code.

In Section~\ref{raise} we will see a more flexible alternative to printing
an error message: raising an exception.


\section{Debugging}
\label{factdebug}

Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural
checkpoints for debugging.  \index{debugging}
If a function is not working, there are
three possibilities to consider:

\begin{itemize}

\item There is something wrong with the arguments the function
is getting; a precondition is violated.

\item There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition
is violated.

\item There is something wrong with the return value or the
way it is being used.

\end{itemize}

To rule out the first possibility, you can add a {\tt print} statement
at the beginning of the function and display the values of the
parameters (and maybe their types).  Or you can write code
that checks the preconditions explicitly.
\index{precondition}
\index{postcondition}

If the parameters look good, add a {\tt print} statement before each
{\tt return} statement that displays the return value.  If
possible, check the result by hand.  Consider calling the
function with values that make it easy to check the result
(as in Section~\ref{incremental.development}).

If the function seems to be working, look at the function call
to make sure the return value is being used correctly (or used
at all!).
\index{flow of execution}

Adding print statements at the beginning and end of a function
can help make the flow of execution more visible.
For example, here is a version of {\tt factorial} with
print statements:

\begin{verbatim}
def factorial(n):
    space = ' ' * (4 * n)
    print space, 'factorial', n
    if n == 0:
        print space, 'returning 1'
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        print space, 'returning', result
        return result
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt space} is a string of space characters that controls the
indentation of the output.  Here is the result of {\tt factorial(5)} :

\begin{verbatim}
                     factorial 5
                 factorial 4
             factorial 3
         factorial 2
     factorial 1
 factorial 0
 returning 1
     returning 1
         returning 2
             returning 6
                 returning 24
                     returning 120
\end{verbatim}
%
If you are confused about the flow of execution, this kind of
output can be helpful.  It takes some time to develop effective

A(m, n) = \begin{cases} 
              n+1 & \mbox{if } m = 0 \\ 
        A(m-1, 1) & \mbox{if } m > 0 \mbox{ and } n = 0 \\

\begin{exercise}
\label{palindrome}

A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and
forward, like ``noon'' and ``redivider''.  Recursively, a word
is a palindrome if the first and last letters are the same
and the middle is a palindrome.
\index{palindrome}

The following are functions that take a string argument and
return the first, last, and middle letters:

\begin{verbatim}
def first(word):
    return word[0]

def last(word):
    return word[-1]

def middle(word):
    return word[1:-1]
\end{verbatim}
%
We'll see how they work in Chapter~\ref{strings}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Type these functions into a file named {\tt palindrome.py}
and test them out.  What happens if you call {\tt middle} with
a string with two letters?  One letter?  What about the empty
string, which is written \verb"''" and contains no letters?

\item Write a function called \verb"is_palindrome" that takes
a string argument and returns {\tt True} if it is a palindrome
and {\tt False} otherwise.  Remember that you can use the
built-in function {\tt len} to check the length of a string.

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$ and $b$ is the largest number
that divides both of them with no remainder.  

One way to find the GCD of two numbers is Euclid's algorithm,
which is based on the observation that if $r$ is the remainder
when $a$ is divided by $b$, then $gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)$.
As a base case, we can use $gcd(a, 0) = a$.

\chapter{Iteration}

\section{Multiple assignment}
\index{assignment}
\index{statement!assignment}
\index{multiple assignment}

As you may have discovered, it is legal to
make more than one assignment to the same variable.  A
new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new
value (and stop referring to the old value).

\begin{verbatim}
bruce = 5
print bruce,
bruce = 7
print bruce
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of this program is {\tt 5 7}, because the first time
{\tt bruce} is printed, its value is 5, and the second time, its
value is 7.  The
comma at the end of the first {\tt print} statement suppresses
the newline, which is why both outputs
appear on the same line.
\index{newline}

Figure~\ref{fig.assign2} shows what {\bf multiple assignment} looks
like in a state diagram. \index{state diagram} \index{diagram!state}

With multiple assignment it is especially important to distinguish
between an assignment operation and a statement of equality.  Because
Python uses the equal sign ({\tt =}) for assignment, it is tempting to
interpret a statement like {\tt a = b} as a statement of equality. It
is not!
\index{equality and assignment}

First, equality is a symmetric relation and assignment is not.  For
example, in mathematics, if $a=7$ then $7=a$.  But in Python, the
statement {\tt a = 7} is legal and {\tt 7 = a} is not.

Furthermore, in mathematics, a statement of equality is either true or
false, for all time.  If $a=b$ now, then $a$ will always equal $b$.
In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but
they don't have to stay that way:

\begin{verbatim}
a = 5
b = a    # a and b are now equal
a = 3    # a and b are no longer equal
\end{verbatim}
%
The third line changes the value of {\tt a} but does not change the
value of {\tt b}, so they are no longer equal. 

Although multiple assignment is frequently helpful, you should use it
with caution.  If the values of variables change frequently, it can
make the code difficult to read and debug.

\begin{figure}

{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/assign2.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.assign2}
\end{figure}



\section{Updating variables}
\label{update}

\index{update}
\index{variable!updating}

One of the most common forms of multiple assignment is an {\bf update},
where the new value of the variable depends on the old.

\begin{verbatim}
x = x+1
\end{verbatim}
%
This means ``get the current value of {\tt x}, add one, and then
update {\tt x} with the new value.''

If you try to update a variable that doesn't exist, you get an
error, because Python evaluates the right side before it assigns
a value to {\tt x}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> x = x+1
NameError: name 'x' is not defined
\end{verbatim}
%
Before you can update a variable, you have to {\bf initialize}
it, usually with a simple assignment:
\index{initialization (before update)}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> x = 0
>>> x = x+1
\end{verbatim}
%
Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an {\bf increment};
subtracting 1 is called a {\bf decrement}.
\index{increment}
\index{decrement}




\section{The {\tt while} statement}
\index{statement!while}
\index{while loop}
\index{loop!while}
\index{iteration}

Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks.  Repeating
identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that
computers do well and people do poorly.

We have seen two programs, {\tt countdown} and \verb"print_n", that
use recursion to perform repetition, which is also called {\bf
iteration}.  Because iteration is so common, Python provides several
language features to make it easier.  One is the {\tt for} statement
we saw in Section~\ref{repetition}.  We'll get back to that later.

Another is the {\tt while} statement.  Here is a version of {\tt
countdown} that uses a {\tt while} statement:

\begin{verbatim}
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        print n
        n = n-1
    print 'Blastoff!'
\end{verbatim}
%
You can almost read the {\tt while} statement as if it were English.
It means, ``While {\tt n} is greater than 0,
display the value of {\tt n} and then reduce the value of
{\tt n} by 1.  When you get to 0, display the word {\tt Blastoff!}''
\index{flow of execution}

More formally, here is the flow of execution for a {\tt while} statement:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Evaluate the condition, yielding {\tt True} or {\tt False}.

\item If the condition is false, exit the {\tt while} statement
and continue execution at the next statement.

\item If the condition is true, execute the
body and then go back to step 1.

\end{enumerate}

This type of flow is called a {\bf loop} because the third step
loops back around to the top.  
\index{condition}
\index{loop}
\index{body}

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables
so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop
terminates.  Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called
an {\bf infinite loop}.  An endless source of amusement for computer
scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo,
``Lather, rinse, repeat,'' are an infinite loop.
\index{infinite loop}
\index{loop!infinite}

In the case of {\tt countdown}, we can prove that the loop
terminates because we know that the value of {\tt n} is finite, and we
can see that the value of {\tt n} gets smaller each time through the
loop, so eventually we have to get to 0.  In other
cases, it is not so easy to tell:

\begin{verbatim}
def sequence(n):
    while n != 1:
        print n,
        if n%2 == 0:        # n is even
            n = n/2
        else:               # n is odd
            n = n*3+1
\end{verbatim}
%
The condition for this loop is {\tt n != 1}, so the loop will continue
until {\tt n} is {\tt 1}, which makes the condition false.

Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of {\tt n}
and then checks whether it is even or odd.  If it is even, {\tt n} is 
divided by 2.  If it is odd, the value of {\tt n} is replaced with
{\tt n*3+1}. For example, if the argument passed
to {\tt sequence} is 3, the resulting sequence is 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Since {\tt n} sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no
obvious proof that {\tt n} will ever reach 1, or that the program
terminates.  For some particular values of {\tt n}, we can prove
termination.  For example, if the starting value is a power of two,
then the value of {\tt n} will be even each time through the loop
until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence,
starting with 16.
\index{Collatz conjecture}

The hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates
for {\em all positive values} of {\tt n}.  So far, no one has
been able to prove it {\em or} disprove it!  (See
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture}.)

\begin{exercise}

Rewrite the function \verb"print_n" from
Section~\ref{recursion} using iteration instead of recursion.

\end{exercise}


\section{{\tt break}}
\index{break statement}
\index{statement!break}

Sometimes you don't know it's time to end a loop until you get half
way through the body.  In that case you can use the {\tt break}
statement to jump out of the loop.

For example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they
type {\tt done}.  You could write:

\begin{verbatim}
while True:
    line = raw_input('> ')
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print line

print 'Done!'
\end{verbatim}
%
The loop condition is {\tt True}, which is always true, so the
loop runs until it hits the break statement.

Each time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket.
If the user types {\tt done}, the {\tt break} statement exits
the loop.  Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types
and goes back to the top of the loop.  Here's a sample run:

\begin{verbatim}
> not done
not done
> done
Done!
\end{verbatim}
%
This way of writing {\tt while} loops is common because you
can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the
top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively
(``stop when this happens'') rather than negatively (``keep going
until that happens.'').


\section{Square roots}
\label{squareroot}
\index{square root}

Loops are often used in programs that compute
numerical results by starting with an approximate answer and
iteratively improving it.
\index{Newton's method}

For example, one way of computing square roots is Newton's method.
Suppose that you want to know the square root of $a$.  If you start
with almost any estimate, $x$, you can compute a better
estimate with the following formula:

\[ y = \frac{x + a/x}{2} \]
%
For example, if $a$ is 4 and $x$ is 3:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> a = 4.0
>>> x = 3.0
>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2
>>> print y
2.16666666667
\end{verbatim}
%
Which is closer to the correct answer ($\sqrt{4} = 2$).  If we
repeat the process with the new estimate, it gets even closer:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> x = y
>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2
>>> print y
2.00641025641
\end{verbatim}
%
After a few more updates, the estimate is almost exact:
\index{update}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> x = y
>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2
>>> print y
2.00001024003
>>> x = y
>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2
>>> print y
2.00000000003
\end{verbatim}
%
In general we don't know ahead of time how many steps it takes
to get to the right answer, but we know when we get there
because the estimate
stops changing:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> x = y
>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2
>>> print y
2.0
>>> x = y
>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2
>>> print y
2.0
\end{verbatim}
%
When {\tt y == x}, we can stop.  Here is a loop that starts
with an initial estimate, {\tt x}, and improves it until it
stops changing:

\begin{verbatim}
while True:
    print x
    y = (x + a/x) / 2
    if y == x:
        break
    x = y
\end{verbatim}
%
For most values of {\tt a} this works fine, but in general it is
dangerous to test {\tt float} equality.
Floating-point values are only approximately right:
most rational numbers, like $1/3$, and irrational numbers, like
$\sqrt{2}$, can't be represented exactly with a {\tt float}.
\index{floating-point}
\index{epsilon}

Rather than checking whether {\tt x} and {\tt y} are exactly equal, it
is safer to use the built-in function {\tt abs} to compute the
absolute value, or magnitude, of the difference between them:

\begin{verbatim}
    if abs(y-x) < epsilon:
        break
\end{verbatim}
%
Where \verb"epsilon" has a value like {\tt 0.0000001} that
determines how close is close enough.

\begin{exercise}

Encapsulate this loop in a function called \verb"square_root"
that takes {\tt a} as a parameter, chooses a reasonable
value of {\tt x}, and returns an estimate of the square root
of {\tt a}.
\index{encapsulation}

\end{exercise}


\section{Algorithms}
\index{algorithm}

Newton's method is an example of an {\bf algorithm}: it is a
mechanical process for solving a category of problems (in this
case, computing square roots).

It is not easy to define an algorithm.  It might help to start
with something that is not an algorithm.  When you learned
to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized the
multiplication table.  In effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions.
That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic.

But if you were ``lazy,'' you probably cheated by learning a few
tricks.  For example, to find the product of $n$ and 9, you can
write $n-1$ as the first digit and $10-n$ as the second
digit.  This trick is a general solution for multiplying any
single-digit number by 9.  That's an algorithm!
\index{addition with carrying}
\index{carrying, addition with}
\index{subtraction!with borrowing}
\index{borrowing, subtraction with}

Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying,
subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms.  One
of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any
intelligence to carry out.  They are mechanical processes in which
each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.

In my opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much time in
school learning to execute algorithms that, quite literally, require
no intelligence.

On the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is interesting,
intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call
programming.

Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or
conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically.
Understanding natural language is a good example.  We all do it, but
so far no one has been able to explain {\em how} we do it, at least
not in the form of an algorithm.


\section{Debugging}

As you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself
spending more time debugging.  More code means more chances to
make an error and more place for bugs to hide.
\index{debugging!by bisection}
\index{bisection, debugging by}

One way to cut your debugging time is ``debugging by bisection.''
For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you
check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.

Instead, try to break the problem in half.  Look at the middle
of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you
can check.  Add a {\tt print} statement (or something else
that has a verifiable effect) and run the program.

If the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the
first half of the program.  If it is correct, the problem is
in the second half.

Every time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of
lines you have to search.  After six steps (which is fewer than 100),
you would be down to one or two lines of code, at least in theory.

In practice it is not always clear what
the ``middle of the program'' is and not always possible to
check it.  It doesn't make sense to count lines and find the
exact midpoint.  Instead, think about places
in the program where there might be errors and places where it
is easy to put a check.  Then choose a spot where you
think the chances are about the same that the bug is before
or after the check.

of the difference between the two estimates.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

<type 'float'>
\end{verbatim}
%
Write a function called \verb"eval_loop" that iteratively
prompts the user, takes the resulting input and evaluates
it using {\tt eval}, and prints the result.

It should continue until the user enters \verb"'done'", and then
return the value of the last expression it evaluated.

\sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}} \]

Write a function called \verb"estimate_pi" that uses this formula
to compute and return an estimate of $\pi$.  It should use a {\tt while}
loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is
smaller than {\tt 1e-15} (which is Python notation for $10^{-15}$).
You can check the result by comparing it to {\tt math.pi}.

\chapter{Strings}
\label{strings}


\section{A string is a sequence}

\index{sequence}
\index{character}
\index{bracket operator}
\index{operator!bracket}
A string is a {\bf sequence} of characters.  
You can access the characters one at a time with the
bracket operator:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> letter = fruit[1]
\end{verbatim}
%
The second statement selects character number 1 from {\tt
fruit} and assigns it to {\tt letter}.  
\index{index}

The expression in brackets is called an {\bf index}.  
The index indicates which character in the sequence you
want (hence the name).

But you might not get what you expect:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print letter
a
\end{verbatim}
%
For most people, the first letter of \verb"'banana'" is {\tt b}, not
{\tt a}.  But for computer scientists, the index is an offset from the
beginning of the string, and the offset of the first letter is zero.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> letter = fruit[0]
>>> print letter
b
\end{verbatim}
%
So {\tt b} is the 0th letter (``zero-eth'') of \verb"'banana'", {\tt a}
is the 1th letter (``one-eth''), and {\tt n} is the 2th (``two-eth'')
letter.
\index{index!starting at zero}
\index{zero, index starting at}

You can use any expression, including variables and operators, as an
index, but the value of the index has to be an integer.  Otherwise you
get:
\index{index}
\index{exception!TypeError}
\index{TypeError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> letter = fruit[1.5]
TypeError: string indices must be integers
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{{\tt len}}
\index{len function}
\index{function!len}

{\tt len} is a built-in function that returns the number of characters
in a string:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> len(fruit)
6
\end{verbatim}
%
To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something
like this:
\index{exception!IndexError}
\index{IndexError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> length = len(fruit)
>>> last = fruit[length]
IndexError: string index out of range
\end{verbatim}
%
The reason for the {\tt IndexError} is that there is no letter in {\tt
'banana'} with the index 6.  Since we started counting at zero, the
six letters are numbered 0 to 5.  To get the last character, you have
to subtract 1 from {\tt length}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> last = fruit[length-1]
>>> print last
a
\end{verbatim}
%
Alternatively, you can use negative indices, which count backward from
the end of the string.  The expression {\tt fruit[-1]} yields the last
letter, {\tt fruit[-2]} yields the second to last, and so on.
\index{index!negative}
\index{negative index}


\section{Traversal with a {\tt for} loop}
\label{for}
\index{traversal}
\index{loop!traversal}
\index{for loop}
\index{loop!for}
\index{statement!for}
\index{traversal}

A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a
time.  Often they start at the beginning, select each character in
turn, do something to it, and continue until the end.  This pattern of
processing is called a {\bf traversal}.  One way to write a traversal
is with a {\tt while} loop:

\begin{verbatim}
index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print letter
    index = index + 1
\end{verbatim}
%
This loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by
itself.  The loop condition is {\tt index < len(fruit)}, so
when {\tt index} is equal to the length of the string, the
condition is false, and the body of the loop is not executed.  The
last character accessed is the one with the index {\tt len(fruit)-1},
which is the last character in the string.

\begin{exercise}

Write a function that takes a string as an argument
and displays the letters backward, one per line.

\end{exercise}

Another way to write a traversal is with a {\tt for} loop:

\begin{verbatim}
for char in fruit:
    print char
\end{verbatim}
%
Each time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned
to the variable {\tt char}.  The loop continues until no characters are
left.
\index{concatenation}
\index{abecedarian}
\index{McCloskey, Robert}

The following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition)
and a {\tt for} loop to generate an abecedarian series (that is, in
alphabetical order).  In Robert McCloskey's book {\em Make
Way for Ducklings}, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack,
Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack.  This loop outputs these names in
order:

\begin{verbatim}
prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffix = 'ack'

for letter in prefixes:
    print letter + suffix
\end{verbatim}
%
The output is:

\begin{verbatim}
Jack
Kack
Lack
Mack
Nack
Oack
Pack
Qack
\end{verbatim}
%
Of course, that's not quite right because ``Ouack'' and
``Quack'' are misspelled.

\begin{exercise}

Modify the program to fix this error.

\end{exercise}



\section{String slices}
\label{slice}
\index{slice operator}
\index{operator!slice}
\index{index!slice}
\index{string!slice}
\index{slice!string}

A segment of a string is called a {\bf slice}.  Selecting a slice is
similar to selecting a character:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> s = 'Monty Python'
>>> print s[0:5]
Monty
>>> print s[6:12]
Python
\end{verbatim}
%
The operator {\tt [n:m]} returns the part of the string from the 
``n-eth'' character to the ``m-eth'' character, including the first but
excluding the last.  This behavior is counterintuitive, but it might
help to imagine the indices pointing {\em between} the
characters, as in Figure~\ref{fig.banana}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/banana.pdf}}
\caption{Slice indices.}
\label{fig.banana}
\end{figure}


If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at
the beginning of the string.  If you omit the second index, the slice
goes to the end of the string:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[:3]
'ban'
>>> fruit[3:]
'ana'
\end{verbatim}
%
If the first index is greater than or equal to the second the result
is an {\bf empty string}, represented by two quotation marks:
\index{quotation mark}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[3:3]
''
\end{verbatim}
%
An empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other
than that, it is the same as any other string.

\begin{exercise}

Given that {\tt fruit} is a string, what does
{\tt fruit[:]} mean?
\index{copy!slice}
\index{slice!copy}

\end{exercise}


\section{Strings are immutable}
\index{mutability}
\index{immutability}
\index{string!immutable}

It is tempting to use the {\tt []} operator on the left side of an
assignment, with the intention of changing a character in a string.
For example:
\index{TypeError}
\index{exception!TypeError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'
>>> greeting[0] = 'J'
TypeError: object does not support item assignment
\end{verbatim}
%
The ``object'' in this case is the string and the ``item'' is
the character you tried to assign.  For now, an {\bf object} is
the same thing as a value, but we will refine that definition
later.  An {\bf item} is one of the values in a sequence.
\index{object}
\index{item assignment}
\index{assignment!item}
\index{immutability}

The reason for the error is that
strings are {\bf immutable}, which means you can't change an
existing string.  The best you can do is create a new string
that is a variation on the original:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'
>>> new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
>>> print new_greeting
Jello, world!
\end{verbatim}
%
This example concatenates a new first letter onto
a slice of {\tt greeting}.  It has no effect on
the original string.
\index{concatenation}


\section{Searching}
\label{find}

What does the following function do?
\index{find function}
\index{function!find}

\begin{verbatim}
def find(word, letter):
    index = 0
    while index < len(word):
        if word[index] == letter:
            return index
        index = index + 1
    return -1
\end{verbatim}
%
In a sense, {\tt find} is the opposite of the {\tt []} operator.
Instead of taking an index and extracting the corresponding character,
it takes a character and finds the index where that character
appears.  If the character is not found, the function returns {\tt
-1}.

This is the first example we have seen of a {\tt return} statement
inside a loop.  If {\tt word[index] == letter}, the function breaks
out of the loop and returns immediately.

If the character doesn't appear in the string, the program
exits the loop normally and  returns {\tt -1}.

This pattern of computation---traversing a sequence and returning
when we find what we are looking for---is called a {\bf search}.
\index{traversal}
\index{search pattern}
\index{pattern!search}

\begin{exercise}

Modify {\tt find} so that it has a
third parameter, the index in {\tt word} where it should start
looking.

\end{exercise}


\section{Looping and counting}
\label{counter}
\index{counter}
\index{counting and looping}
\index{looping and counting}
\index{looping!with strings}

The following program counts the number of times the letter {\tt a}
appears in a string:

\begin{verbatim}
word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a':
        count = count + 1
print count
\end{verbatim}
%
This program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a {\bf
counter}.  The variable {\tt count} is initialized to 0 and then
incremented each time an {\tt a} is found.
When the loop exits, {\tt count}
contains the result---the total number of {\tt a}'s.

\begin{exercise}
\index{encapsulation}

Encapsulate this code in a function named {\tt
count}, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the
letter as arguments.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Rewrite this function so that instead of
traversing the string, it uses the three-parameter version of {\tt
find} from the previous section.

\end{exercise}


\section{String methods}

A {\bf method} is similar to a function---it takes arguments and
returns a value---but the syntax is different.  For example, the
method {\tt upper} takes a string and returns a new string with
all uppercase letters:
\index{method}
\index{string!method}

Instead of the function syntax {\tt upper(word)}, it uses
the method syntax {\tt word.upper()}.
\index{dot notation}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> word = 'banana'
>>> new_word = word.upper()
>>> print new_word
BANANA
\end{verbatim}
%
This form of dot notation specifies the name of the method, {\tt
upper}, and the name of the string to apply the method to, {\tt
word}.  The empty parentheses indicate that this method takes no
argument.
\index{parentheses!empty}

A method call is called an {\bf invocation}; in this case, we would
say that we are invoking {\tt upper} on the {\tt word}.
\index{invocation}

As it turns out, there is a string method named {\tt find} that
is remarkably similar to the function we wrote:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> word = 'banana'
>>> index = word.find('a')
>>> print index
1
\end{verbatim}
%
In this example, we invoke {\tt find} on {\tt word} and pass
the letter we are looking for as a parameter.

Actually, the {\tt find} method is more general than our function;
it can find substrings, not just characters:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> word.find('na')
2
\end{verbatim}
%
It can take as a second argument the index where it should start:
\index{optional argument}
\index{argument!optional}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> word.find('na', 3)
4
\end{verbatim}
%
And as a third argument the index where it should stop:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> name = 'bob'
>>> name.find('b', 1, 2)
-1
\end{verbatim}
%
This search fails because {\tt b} does not
appear in the index range from {\tt 1} to {\tt 2} (not including {\tt
2}).


\begin{exercise}
\index{count method}
\index{method!count}

There is a string method called {\tt count} that is similar
to the function in the previous exercise.  Read the documentation
of this method
and write an invocation that counts the number of {\tt a}s
in \verb"'banana'".
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\index{string method}
\index{method!string}

Read the documentation of the string methods at
\url{docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html}.  You
might want to experiment with some of them to make sure
you understand how they work.  {\tt strip} and
{\tt replace} are particularly useful.

The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing.
For example, in \verb"find(sub[, start[, end]])", the brackets
indicate optional arguments.  So {\tt sub} is required, but
{\tt start} is optional, and if you include {\tt start},
then {\tt end} is optional.
\end{exercise}


\section{The {\tt in} operator}
\label{inboth}
\index{in operator}
\index{operator!in}
\index{boolean operator}
\index{operator!boolean}

The word {\tt in} is a boolean operator that takes two strings and
returns {\tt True} if the first appears as a substring in the second:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 'a' in 'banana'
True
>>> 'seed' in 'banana'
False
\end{verbatim}
%
For example, the following function prints all the
letters from {\tt word1} that also appear in {\tt word2}:

\begin{verbatim}
def in_both(word1, word2):
    for letter in word1:
        if letter in word2:
            print letter
\end{verbatim}
%
With well-chosen variable names,
Python sometimes reads like English.  You could read
this loop, ``for (each) letter in (the first) word, if (the) letter 
(appears) in (the second) word, print (the) letter.''

Here's what you get if you compare apples and oranges:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> in_both('apples', 'oranges')
a
e
s
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{String comparison}
\index{string!comparison}
\index{comparison!string}

The relational operators work on strings.  To see if two strings are equal:

\begin{verbatim}
if word == 'banana':
    print 'All right, bananas.'
\end{verbatim}
%
Other relational operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical
order:

\begin{verbatim}
if word < 'banana':
    print 'Your word,' + word + ', comes before banana.'
elif word > 'banana':
    print 'Your word,' + word + ', comes after banana.'
else:
    print 'All right, bananas.'
\end{verbatim}
%
Python does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way
that people do.  All the uppercase letters come before all the
lowercase letters, so:

\begin{verbatim}
Your word, Pineapple, comes before banana.
\end{verbatim}
%
A common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a
standard format, such as all lowercase, before performing the
comparison.  Keep that in mind in case you have to defend yourself
against a man armed with a Pineapple.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}
\index{traversal}

When you use indices to traverse the values in a sequence,
it is tricky to get the beginning and end of the traversal
right.  Here is a function that is supposed to compare two
words and return {\tt True} if one of the words is the reverse
of the other, but it contains two errors:

\begin{verbatim}
def is_reverse(word1, word2):
    if len(word1) != len(word2):
        return False
    
    i = 0
    j = len(word2)

    while j > 0:
        if word1[i] != word2[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1

    return True
\end{verbatim}
%
The first {\tt if} statement checks whether the words are the
same length.  If not, we can return {\tt False} immediately
and then, for the rest of the function, we can assume that the words
are the same length.  This is an example of the guardian pattern
in Section~\ref{guardian}.
\index{guardian pattern}
\index{pattern!guardian}
\index{index}

{\tt i} and {\tt j} are indices: {\tt i} traverses {\tt word1}
forward while {\tt j} traverses {\tt word2} backward.  If we find
two letters that don't match, we can return {\tt False} immediately.
If we get through the whole loop and all the letters match, we
return {\tt True}.

If we test this function with the words ``pots'' and ``stop'', we
expect the return value {\tt True}, but we get an IndexError:
\index{IndexError}
\index{exception!IndexError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop')
...
  File "reverse.py", line 15, in is_reverse
    if word1[i] != word2[j]:
IndexError: string index out of range
\end{verbatim}
%
For debugging this kind of error, my first move is to
print the values of the indices immediately before the line
where the error appears.

\begin{verbatim}
    while j > 0:
        print i, j        # print here
        
        if word1[i] != word2[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1
\end{verbatim}
%
Now when I run the program again, I get more information:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop')
0 4
...
IndexError: string index out of range
\end{verbatim}
%
The first time through the loop, the value of {\tt j} is 4,
which is out of range for the string \verb"'pots'".
The index of the last character is 3, so the
initial value for {\tt j} should be {\tt len(word2)-1}.
\index{semantic error}
\index{error!semantic}

If I fix that error and run the program again, I get:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop')
0 3
1 2
2 1
True
\end{verbatim}
%
This time we get the right answer, but it looks like the loop only ran
three times, which is suspicious.  To get a better idea of what is
happening, it is useful to draw a state diagram.  During the first
iteration, the frame for \verb"is_reverse" is shows in Figure~\ref{fig.state4}.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/state4.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.state4}
\end{figure}


I took a little license by arranging the variables in the frame
and adding dotted lines to show that the values of {\tt i} and
{\tt j} indicate characters in {\tt word1} and {\tt word2}.

\begin{exercise}
\label{isreverse}

Starting with this diagram, execute the program on paper, changing the
values of {\tt i} and {\tt j} during each iteration.  Find and fix the
second error in this function.

\end{exercise}

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
\index{step size}
\index{slice operator}
\index{operator!slice}

A string slice can take a third index that specifies the ``step
size;'' that is, the number of spaces between successive characters.
A step size of 2 means every other character; 3 means every third,
etc.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[0:5:2]
'bnn'
\end{verbatim}

A step size of -1 goes through the word backwards, so
the slice \verb"[::-1]" generates a reversed string.
\index{palindrome}

Use this idiom to write a one-line version of \verb"is_palindrome"
from Exercise~\ref{palindrome}.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

The following functions are all {\em intended} to check whether a
string contains any lowercase letters, but at least some of them are
wrong.  For each function, describe what the function actually does
(assuming that the parameter is a string).

\begin{verbatim}
def any_lowercase1(s):
    for c in s:
        if c.islower():
            return True
        else:
            return False

def any_lowercase2(s):
    for c in s:
        if 'c'.islower():
            return 'True'
        else:
            return 'False'

def any_lowercase3(s):
    for c in s:
        flag = c.islower()
    return flag

def any_lowercase4(s):
    flag = False
    for c in s:
        flag = flag or c.islower()
    return flag

def any_lowercase5(s):
    for c in s:
        if not c.islower():
            return False
    return True
\end{verbatim}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{exrotate}

ROT13 is a weak form of encryption that involves ``rotating'' each
letter in a word by 13 places.  To rotate a letter means
to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if
necessary, so 'A' shifted by 3 is 'D' and 'Z' shifted by 1 is 'A'.
\index{letter rotation}
\index{rotation, letter}

Write a function called \verb"rotate_word"
that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and that returns
a new string that contains the letters from the original string
``rotated'' by the given amount.  

For example, ``cheer'' rotated by 7 is ``jolly'' and ``melon'' rotated
by -10 is ``cubed''.  

%For example ``sleep''
%rotated by 9 is ``bunny'' and ``latex'' rotated by 7 is ``shale''.

You might want to use the built-in functions {\tt ord}, which converts
a character to a numeric code, and {\tt chr}, which converts numeric
codes to characters.

Potentially offensive jokes on the Internet are sometimes encoded
in ROT13.  If you are not easily offended, find and decode some
of them.  Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/rotate.py}.

\end{exercise}


\chapter{Case study: word play}

\section{Reading word lists}
\label{wordlist}

For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words.
There are lots of word lists available on the Web, but the one most
suitable for our purpose is one of the word lists collected and
contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby
lexicon project (see \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project}).  It
is a list of 113,809 official crosswords; that is, words that are
considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games.  In the
Moby collection, the filename is {\tt 113809of.fic}; you can download
a copy, with the simpler name {\tt words.txt}, from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/words.txt}.
\index{Moby Project}
\index{crosswords}

This file is in plain text, so you can open it with a text
editor, but you can also read it from Python.  The built-in
function {\tt open} takes the name of the file as a parameter
and returns a {\bf file object} you can use to read the file.
\index{open function}
\index{function!open}
\index{plain text}
\index{text!plain}
\index{object!file}
\index{file object}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fin = open('words.txt')
>>> print fin
<open file 'words.txt', mode 'r' at 0xb7f4b380>
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt fin} is a common name for a file object used for
input.  Mode \verb"'r'" indicates that this file is open for
reading (as opposed to \verb"'w'" for writing).
\index{readline method}
\index{method!readline}

The file object provides several methods for reading, including
{\tt readline}, which reads characters from the file
until it gets to a newline and returns the result as a
string:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fin.readline()
'aa\r\n'
\end{verbatim}
%
The first word in this particular list is ``aa,'' which is a kind of
lava.  The sequence \verb"\r\n" represents two whitespace characters,
a carriage return and a newline, that separate this word from the
next.

The file object keeps track of where it is in the file, so
if you call {\tt readline} again, you get the next word:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fin.readline()
'aah\r\n'
\end{verbatim}
%
The next word is ``aah,'' which is a perfectly legitimate
word, so stop looking at me like that.
Or, if it's the whitespace that's bothering you,
we can get rid of it with the string method {\tt strip}:
\index{strip method}
\index{method!strip}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> line = fin.readline()
>>> word = line.strip()
>>> print word
aahed
\end{verbatim}
%
You can also use a file object as part of a {\tt for} loop.
This program reads {\tt words.txt} and prints each word, one
per line:
\index{open function}
\index{function!open}

\begin{verbatim}
fin = open('words.txt')
for line in fin:
    word = line.strip()
    print word
\end{verbatim}
%

\begin{exercise}

Write a program that reads {\tt words.txt} and prints only the
words with more than 20 characters (not counting whitespace).
\index{whitespace}

\end{exercise}


\section{Exercises}

There are solutions to these exercises in the next section.
You should at least attempt each one before you read the solutions.

\begin{exercise}

In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called
{\em Gadsby} that does not contain the letter ``e.''  Since ``e'' is
the most common letter in English, that's not easy to do.

In fact, it is difficult to construct a solitary thought without using
that most common symbol.  It is slow going at first, but with caution
and hours of training you can gradually gain facility.

All right, I'll stop now.

Write a function called \verb"has_no_e" that returns {\tt True} if
the given word doesn't have the letter ``e'' in it.

Modify your program from the previous section to print only the words
that have no ``e'' and compute the percentage of the words in the list
have no ``e.''
\index{lipogram}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} 

Write a function named {\tt avoids}
that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and
that returns {\tt True} if the word doesn't use any of the forbidden
letters.

Modify your program to prompt the user to enter a string
of forbidden letters and then print the number of words that
don't contain any of them.
Can you find a combination of 5 forbidden letters that
excludes the smallest number of words?

\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}

Write a function named \verb"uses_only" that takes a word and a
string of letters, and that returns {\tt True} if the word contains
only letters in the list.  Can you make a sentence using only the
letters {\tt acefhlo}?  Other than ``Hoe alfalfa?''

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} 

Write a function named \verb"uses_all" that takes a word and a
string of required letters, and that returns {\tt True} if the word
uses all the required letters at least once.  How many words are there
that use all the vowels {\tt aeiou}?  How about {\tt aeiouy}?

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Write a function called \verb"is_abecedarian" that returns
{\tt True} if the letters in a word appear in alphabetical order
(double letters are ok).  
How many abecedarian words are there?

\index{abecedarian}

\end{exercise}


%\begin{exercise}
%\label{palindrome}
%A palindrome is a word that reads the same
%forward and backward, like ``rotator'' and ``noon.''
%Write a boolean function named \verb"is_palindrome" that
%takes a string as a parameter and returns {\tt True} if it is
%a palindrome.

%Modify your program from the previous section to print all
%of the palindromes in the word list and then print the total
%number of palindromes.
%\end{exercise}



\section{Search}
\index{search pattern}
\index{pattern!search}

All of the exercises in the previous section have something
in common; they can be solved with the search pattern we saw
in Section~\ref{find}.  The simplest example is:

\begin{verbatim}
def has_no_e(word):
    for letter in word:
        if letter == 'e':
            return False
    return True
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt for} loop traverses the characters in {\tt word}.  If we find
the letter ``e'', we can immediately return {\tt False}; otherwise we
have to go to the next letter.  If we exit the loop normally, that
means we didn't find an ``e'', so we return {\tt True}.
\index{traversal}

% Removing this because we haven't seen the in operator yet.
%\index{in operator}
%\index{operator!in}

%You could write this function more concisely using the {\tt in}
%operator, but I started with this version because it 
%demonstrates the logic of the search pattern.
\index{generalization}

{\tt avoids} is a more general version of \verb"has_no_e" but it
has the same structure:

\begin{verbatim}
def avoids(word, forbidden):
    for letter in word:
        if letter in forbidden:
            return False
    return True
\end{verbatim}
%
We can return {\tt False} as soon as we find a forbidden letter;
if we get to the end of the loop, we return {\tt True}.

\verb"uses_only" is similar except that the sense of the condition
is reversed:

\begin{verbatim}
def uses_only(word, available):
    for letter in word: 
        if letter not in available:
            return False
    return True
\end{verbatim}
%
Instead of a list of forbidden letters, we have a list of available
letters.  If we find a letter in {\tt word} that is not in
{\tt available}, we can return {\tt False}.

\verb"uses_all" is similar except that we reverse the role
of the word and the string of letters:

\begin{verbatim}
def uses_all(word, required):
    for letter in required: 
        if letter not in word:
            return False
    return True
\end{verbatim}
%
Instead of traversing the letters in {\tt word}, the loop
traverses the required letters.  If any of the required letters
do not appear in the word, we can return {\tt False}.
\index{traversal}

If you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would
have recognized that \verb"uses_all" was an instance of a
previously-solved problem, and you would have written:

\begin{verbatim}
def uses_all(word, required):
    return uses_only(required, word)
\end{verbatim}
%
This is an example of a program development method called {\bf problem
recognition}, which means that you recognize the problem you are
working on as an instance of a previously-solved problem, and apply a
previously-developed solution.

\section{Looping with indices}
\index{looping!with indices}
\index{index!looping with}

I wrote the functions in the previous section with {\tt for}
loops because I only needed the characters in the strings; I didn't
have to do anything with the indices.

For \verb"is_abecedarian" we have to compare adjacent letters,
which is a little tricky with a {\tt for} loop:

\begin{verbatim}
def is_abecedarian(word):
    previous = word[0]
    for c in word:
        if c < previous:
            return False
        previous = c
    return True
\end{verbatim}


An alternative is to
use recursion:

\begin{verbatim}
def is_abecedarian(word):
    if len(word) <= 1:
        return True
    if word[0] > word[1]:
        return False
    return is_abecedarian(word[1:])
\end{verbatim}

Another option is to use a {\tt while} loop:

\begin{verbatim}
def is_abecedarian(word):
    i = 0
    while i < len(word)-1:
        if word[i+1] < word[i]:
            return False
        i = i+1
    return True
\end{verbatim}
%
The loop starts at {\tt i=0} and ends when {\tt i=len(word)-1}.  Each
time through the loop, it compares the $i$th character (which you can
think of as the current character) to the $i+1$th character (which you
can think of as the next).

If the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current
one, then we have discovered a break in the abecedarian trend, and
we return {\tt False}.

If we get to the end of the loop without finding a fault, then the
word passes the test.  To convince yourself that the loop ends
correctly, consider an example like \verb"'flossy'".  The
length of the word is 6, so
the last time the loop runs is when {\tt i} is 4, which is the
index of the second-to-last character.  On the last iteration,
it compares the second-to-last character to the last, which is
what we want.
\index{palindrome}

Here is a version of \verb"is_palindrome" (see
Exercise~\ref{palindrome}) that uses two indices; one starts at the
beginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down.

\begin{verbatim}
def is_palindrome(word):
    i = 0
    j = len(word)-1

    while i<j:
        if word[i] != word[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1

    return True
\end{verbatim}

Or, if you noticed that this is an instance of a previously-solved
problem, you might have written:

\begin{verbatim}
def is_palindrome(word):
    return is_reverse(word, word)
\end{verbatim}
\index{problem recognition}
\index{development plan!problem recognition}

Assuming you did Exercise~\ref{isreverse}.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}
\index{testing!is hard}
\index{program testing}

Testing programs is hard.  The functions in this chapter are
relatively easy to test because you can check the results by hand.
Even so, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to choose a
set of words that test for all possible errors.

Taking \verb"has_no_e" as an example, there are two obvious
cases to check: words that have an 'e' should return {\tt False};
words that don't should return {\tt True}.  You should have no
trouble coming up with one of each.

Within each case, there are some less obvious subcases.  Among the
words that have an ``e,'' you should test words with an ``e'' at the
beginning, the end, and somewhere in the middle.  You should test long
words, short words, and very short words, like the empty string.  The
empty string is an example of a {\bf special case}, which is one of
the non-obvious cases where errors often lurk.
\index{special case}

In addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test
your program with a word list like {\tt words.txt}.  By scanning
the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful:
you might catch one kind of error (words that should not be
included, but are) and not another (words that should be included,
but aren't).

In general, testing can help you find bugs, but it is not easy to
generate a good set of test cases, and even if you do, you can't
be sure your program is correct.
\index{testing!and absence of bugs}

According to a legendary computer scientist:

show their absence!

\begin{quote}
Give me a word with three consecutive double letters. I'll give you a
couple of words that almost qualify, but don't. For example, the word
committee, c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. It would be great except for the `i' that
sneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i. If you could
take out those i's it would work. But there is a word that has three
consecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may
be the only word. Of course there are probably 500 more but I can only
think of one. What is the word?

\chapter{Lists}

\section{A list is a sequence}
\label{sequence}

Like a string, a {\bf list} is a sequence of values.  In a string, the
values are characters; in a list, they can be any type.  The values in
a list are called {\bf elements} or sometimes {\bf items}.
\index{list}
\index{type!list}
\index{element}
\index{sequence}
\index{item}

There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to
enclose the elements in square brackets (\verb"[" and \verb"]"):

\begin{verbatim}
[10, 20, 30, 40]
['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit']
\end{verbatim}
%
The first example is a list of four integers.  The second is a list of
three strings.  The elements of a list don't have to be the same type.
The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and
(lo!) another list:

\begin{verbatim}
['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]
\end{verbatim}
%
A list within another list is {\bf nested}.
\index{nested list}
\index{list!nested}

A list that contains no elements is
called an empty list; you can create one with empty
brackets, \verb"[]".
\index{empty list}
\index{list!empty}

As you might expect, you can assign list values to variables:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
>>> numbers = [17, 123]
>>> empty = []
>>> print cheeses, numbers, empty
['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [17, 123] []
\end{verbatim}
%
\index{assignment}


\section{Lists are mutable}
\label{mutable}
\index{list!element}
\index{access}
\index{index}
\index{bracket operator}
\index{operator!bracket}

The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for
accessing the characters of a string---the bracket operator.  The
expression inside the brackets specifies the index.  Remember that the
indices start at 0:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print cheeses[0]
Cheddar
\end{verbatim}
%
Unlike strings, lists are mutable.  When the bracket operator appears
on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the
list that will be assigned.
\index{mutability}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> numbers = [17, 123]
>>> numbers[1] = 5
>>> print numbers
[17, 5]
\end{verbatim}
%
The one-eth element of {\tt numbers}, which
used to be 123, is now 5.
\index{index!starting at zero}
\index{zero, index starting at}

You can think of a list as a relationship between indices and
elements.  This relationship is called a {\bf mapping}; each index
``maps to'' one of the elements.  Figure~\ref{fig.liststate} shows 
the state diagram for {\tt
cheeses}, {\tt numbers} and {\tt empty}:
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}
\index{mapping}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/liststate.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.liststate}
\end{figure}

Lists are represented by boxes with the word ``list'' outside
and the elements of the list inside.  {\tt cheeses} refers to
a list with three elements indexed 0, 1 and 2.
{\tt numbers} contains two elements; the diagram shows that the
value of the second element has been reassigned from 123 to 5.
{\tt empty} refers to a list with no elements.
\index{item assignment}
\index{assignment!item}

List indices work the same way as string indices:

\begin{itemize}

\item Any integer expression can be used as an index.

\item If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you
get an {\tt IndexError}.
\index{exception!IndexError}
\index{IndexError}

\item If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the
end of the list.

\end{itemize}
\index{list!index}

\index{list!membership}
\index{membership!list}
\index{in operator}
\index{operator!in}

The {\tt in} operator also works on lists.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
>>> 'Edam' in cheeses
True
>>> 'Brie' in cheeses
False
\end{verbatim}


\section{Traversing a list}
\index{list!traversal}
\index{traversal!list}
\index{for loop}
\index{loop!for}
\index{statement!for}

The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is
with a {\tt for} loop.  The syntax is the same as for strings:

\begin{verbatim}
for cheese in cheeses:
    print cheese
\end{verbatim}
%
This works well if you only need to read the elements of the
list.  But if you want to write or update the elements, you
need the indices.  A common way to do that is to combine
the functions {\tt range} and {\tt len}:
\index{looping!with indices}
\index{index!looping with}

\begin{verbatim}
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
\end{verbatim}
%
This loop traverses the list and updates each element.  {\tt len}
returns the number of elements in the list.  {\tt range} returns
a list of indices from 0 to $n-1$, where $n$ is the length of
the list.  Each time through the loop {\tt i} gets the index
of the next element.  The assignment statement in the body uses
{\tt i} to read the old value of the element and to assign the
new value.
\index{item update}
\index{update!item}

A {\tt for} loop over an empty list never executes the body:

\begin{verbatim}
for x in []:
    print 'This never happens.'
\end{verbatim}
%
Although a list can contain another list, the nested
list still counts as a single element.  The length of this list is
four:
\index{nested list}
\index{list!nested}

\begin{verbatim}
['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]]
\end{verbatim}



\section{List operations}
\index{list!operation}

The {\tt +} operator concatenates lists:
\index{concatenation!list}
\index{list!concatenation}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> c = a + b
>>> print c
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
\end{verbatim}
%
Similarly, the {\tt *} operator repeats a list a given number of times:
\index{repetition!list}
\index{list!repetition}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> [0] * 4
[0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
\end{verbatim}
%
The first example repeats {\tt [0]} four times.  The second example
repeats the list {\tt [1, 2, 3]} three times.


\section{List slices}
\index{slice operator}
\index{operator!slice}
\index{index!slice}
\index{list!slice}
\index{slice!list}

The slice operator also works on lists:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> t[1:3]
['b', 'c']
>>> t[:4]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> t[3:]
['d', 'e', 'f']
\end{verbatim}
%
If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning.
If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end.  So if you
omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.
\index{list!copy}
\index{slice!copy}
\index{copy!slice}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t[:]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
\end{verbatim}
%
Since lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy
before performing operations that fold, spindle or mutilate
lists.
\index{mutability}

A slice operator on the left side of an assignment
can update multiple elements:
\index{slice!update}
\index{update!slice}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> t[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
>>> print t
['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f']
\end{verbatim}
%

% You can add elements to a list by squeezing them into an empty
% slice:

% % \begin{verbatim}
% >>> t = ['a', 'd', 'e', 'f']
% >>> t[1:1] = ['b', 'c']
% >>> print t
% ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
% \end{verbatim}
% \afterverb
%
% And you can remove elements from a list by assigning the empty list to
% them:

% % \begin{verbatim}
% >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
% >>> t[1:3] = []
% >>> print t
% ['a', 'd', 'e', 'f']
% \end{verbatim}
% \afterverb
%
% But both of those operations can be expressed more clearly
% with list methods.


\section{List methods}
\index{list!method}
\index{method, list}

Python provides methods that operate on lists.  For example,
{\tt append} adds a new element to the end of a list:
\index{append method}
\index{method!append}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> t.append('d')
>>> print t
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt extend} takes a list as an argument and appends all of
the elements:
\index{extend method}
\index{method!extend}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> t2 = ['d', 'e']
>>> t1.extend(t2)
>>> print t1
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
\end{verbatim}
%
This example leaves {\tt t2} unmodified.

{\tt sort} arranges the elements of the list from low to high:
\index{sort method}
\index{method!sort}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a']
>>> t.sort()
>>> print t
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
\end{verbatim}
%
List methods are all void; they modify the list and return {\tt None}.
If you accidentally write {\tt t = t.sort()}, you will be disappointed
with the result.
\index{void method}
\index{method!void}
\index{None special value}
\index{special value!None}


\section{Map, filter and reduce}

To add up all the numbers in a list, you can use a loop like this:

% see add.py

\begin{verbatim}
def add_all(t):
    total = 0
    for x in t:
        total += x
    return total
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt total} is initialized to 0.  Each time through the loop,
{\tt x} gets one element from the list.  The {\tt +=} operator
provides a short way to update a variable.  This 
{\bf augmented assignment statement}:
\index{update operator}
\index{operator!update}
\index{assignment!augmented}
\index{augmented assignment}

\begin{verbatim}
    total += x
\end{verbatim}
%
is equivalent to:

\begin{verbatim}
    total = total + x
\end{verbatim}
%
As the loop executes, {\tt total} accumulates the sum of the
elements; a variable used this way is sometimes called an
{\bf accumulator}.
\index{accumulator!sum}

Adding up the elements of a list is such a common operation
that Python provides it as a built-in function, {\tt sum}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> sum(t)
6
\end{verbatim}
%
An operation like this that combines a sequence of elements into
a single value is sometimes called {\bf reduce}.
\index{reduce pattern}
\index{pattern!reduce}
\index{traversal}

\begin{exercise}

Write a function called \verb"nested_sum" that takes a nested list
of integers and add up the elements from all of the nested lists.

\end{exercise}

Sometimes you want to traverse one list while building
another.  For example, the following function takes a list of strings
and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings:

\begin{verbatim}
def capitalize_all(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        res.append(s.capitalize())
    return res
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt res} is initialized with an empty list; each time through
the loop, we append the next element.  So {\tt res} is another
kind of accumulator.
\index{accumulator!list}

An operation like \verb"capitalize_all" is sometimes called a {\bf
map} because it ``maps'' a function (in this case the method {\tt
capitalize}) onto each of the elements in a sequence.
\index{map pattern}
\index{pattern!map}
\index{filter pattern}
\index{pattern!filter}

\begin{exercise}

Use \verb"capitalize_all" to write a function named \verb"capitalize_nested"
that takes a nested list of strings and returns a new nested list
with all strings capitalized.

\end{exercise}

Another common operation is to select some of the elements from
a list and return a sublist.  For example, the following
function takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains
only the uppercase strings:

\begin{verbatim}
def only_upper(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        if s.isupper():
            res.append(s)
    return res
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt isupper} is a string method that returns {\tt True} if
the string contains only upper case letters.

An operation like \verb"only_upper" is called a {\bf filter} because
it selects some of the elements and filters out the others.

Most common list operations can be expressed as a combination
of map, filter and reduce.  Because these operations are
so common, Python provides language features to support them,
including the built-in function {\tt map} and an operator
called a ``list comprehension.''
\index{list!comprehension}

\begin{exercise}
\label{cumulative}
\index{cumulative sum}

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the
cumulative sum; that is, a new list where the $i$th element
is the sum of the first $i+1$ elements from the original list.
For example, the cumulative sum of {\tt [1, 2, 3]} is
{\tt [1, 3, 6]}. 
\end{exercise}


\section{Deleting elements}
\index{element deletion}
\index{deletion, element of list}

There are several ways to delete elements from a list.  If you
know the index of the element you want, you can use
{\tt pop}:
\index{pop method}
\index{method!pop}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> x = t.pop(1)
>>> print t
['a', 'c']
>>> print x
b
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt pop} modifies the list and returns the element that was removed.
If you don't provide an index, it deletes and returns the
last element.

If you don't need the removed value, you can use the {\tt del}
operator:
\index{del operator}
\index{operator!del}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> del t[1]
>>> print t
['a', 'c']
\end{verbatim}
%

If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you
can use {\tt remove}:
\index{remove method}
\index{method!remove}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> t.remove('b')
>>> print t
['a', 'c']
\end{verbatim}
%
The return value from {\tt remove} is {\tt None}.
\index{None special value}
\index{special value!None}

To remove more than one element, you can use {\tt del} with
a slice index:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> del t[1:5]
>>> print t
['a', 'f']
\end{verbatim}
%
As usual, the slice selects all the elements up to, but not
including, the second index.

\begin{exercise}

Write a function called \verb"middle" that takes a list and
returns a new list that contains all but the first and last
elements.  So \verb"middle([1,2,3,4])" should return \verb"[2,3]".

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Write a function called \verb"chop" that takes a list, modifies it
by removing the first and last elements, and returns {\tt None}.

\end{exercise}


\section{Lists and strings}
\index{list}
\index{string}
\index{sequence}

A string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence
of values, but a list of characters is not the same as a
string.  To convert from a string to a list of characters,
you can use {\tt list}:
\index{list!function}
\index{function!list}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> s = 'spam'
>>> t = list(s)
>>> print t
['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']
\end{verbatim}
%
Because {\tt list} is the name of a built-in function, you should
avoid using it as a variable name.  I also avoid {\tt l} because
it looks too much like {\tt 1}.  So that's why I use {\tt t}.

The {\tt list} function breaks a string into individual letters.  If
you want to break a string into words, you can use the {\tt split}
method:
\index{split method}
\index{method!split}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> s = 'pining for the fjords'
>>> t = s.split()
>>> print t
['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
\end{verbatim}
%
An optional argument called a {\bf delimiter} specifies which
characters to use as word boundaries.
The following example
uses a hyphen as a delimiter:
\index{optional argument}
\index{argument!optional}
\index{delimiter}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> s = 'spam-spam-spam'
>>> delimiter = '-'
>>> s.split(delimiter)
['spam', 'spam', 'spam']
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt join} is the inverse of {\tt split}.  It
takes a list of strings and
concatenates the elements.  {\tt join} is a string method,
so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the
list as a parameter:
\index{join method}
\index{method!join}
\index{concatenation}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
>>> delimiter = ' '
>>> delimiter.join(t)
'pining for the fjords'
\end{verbatim}
%
In this case the delimiter is a space character, so
{\tt join} puts a space between words.  To concatenate
strings without spaces, you can use the empty string,
\verb"''", as a delimiter. 
\index{empty string}
\index{string!empty}


\section{Objects and values}
\index{object}
\index{value}

If we execute these assignment statements:

\begin{verbatim}
a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'
\end{verbatim}
%
We know that {\tt a} and {\tt b} both refer to a
string, but we don't
know whether they refer to the {\em same} string.
There are two possible states, shown in Figure~\ref{fig.list1}.
\index{aliasing}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/list1.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.list1}
\end{figure}


In one case, {\tt a} and {\tt b} refer to two different objects that
have the same value.  In the second case, they refer to the same
object.
\index{is operator}
\index{operator!is}

To check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can
use the {\tt is} operator.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> a = 'banana'
>>> b = 'banana'
>>> a is b
True
\end{verbatim}
%
In this example, Python only created one string object,
and both {\tt a} and {\tt b} refer to it.

But when you create two lists, you get two objects:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a is b
False
\end{verbatim}
%
So the state diagram looks like Figure~\ref{fig.list2}.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/list2.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.list2}
\end{figure}


In this case we would say that the two lists are {\bf equivalent},
because they have the same elements, but not {\bf identical}, because
they are not the same object.  If two objects are identical, they are
also equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily
identical.
\index{equivalence}
\index{identity}

Until now, we have been using ``object'' and ``value''
interchangeably, but it is more precise to say that an object has a
value.  If you execute {\tt [1,2,3]}, you get a list
object whose value is a sequence of integers.  If another
list has the same elements, we say it has the same value, but
it is not the same object.
\index{object}
\index{value}


\section{Aliasing}
\index{aliasing}
\index{reference!aliasing}

If {\tt a} refers to an object and you assign {\tt b = a},
then both variables refer to the same object:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = a
>>> b is a
True
\end{verbatim}
%
The state diagram looks like Figure~\ref{fig.list3}.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/list3.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.list3}
\end{figure}

The association of a variable with an object is called a {\bf
reference}.  In this example, there are two references to the same
object.
\index{reference}

An object with more than one reference has more
than one name, so we say that the object is {\bf aliased}.
\index{mutability}

If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect
the other:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> b[0] = 17
>>> print a
[17, 2, 3]
\end{verbatim}
%
Although this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone.  In general,
it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable
objects.
\index{immutability}

For immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a
problem.  In this example:

\begin{verbatim}
a = 'banana'
b = 'banana'
\end{verbatim}
%
It almost never makes a difference whether {\tt a} and {\tt b} refer
to the same string or not.


\section{List arguments}
\label{list.arguments}
\index{list!as argument}
\index{argument}
\index{argument!list}
\index{reference}
\index{parameter}

When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference
to the list.
If the function modifies a list parameter, the caller sees the change.
For example, \verb"delete_head" removes the first element from a list:

\begin{verbatim}
def delete_head(t):
    del t[0]
\end{verbatim}
%
Here's how it is used:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> delete_head(letters)
>>> print letters
['b', 'c']
\end{verbatim}
%
The parameter {\tt t} and the variable {\tt letters} are
aliases for the same object.  The stack diagram looks like
Figure~\ref{fig.stack5}.
\index{stack diagram}
\index{diagram!stack}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/stack5.pdf}}
\caption{Stack diagram.}
\label{fig.stack5}
\end{figure}


Since the list is shared by two frames, I drew
it between them.

It is important to distinguish between operations that
modify lists and operations that create new lists.  For
example, the {\tt append} method modifies a list, but the
{\tt +} operator creates a new list:
\index{append method}
\index{method!append}
\index{list!concatenation}
\index{concatenation!list}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t1 = [1, 2]
>>> t2 = t1.append(3)
>>> print t1
[1, 2, 3]
>>> print t2
None

>>> t3 = t1 + [4]
>>> print t3
[1, 2, 3, 4]
\end{verbatim}

This difference is important when you write functions that
are supposed to modify lists.  For example, this function
{\em does not} delete the head of a list:

\begin{verbatim}
def bad_delete_head(t):
    t = t[1:]              # WRONG!
\end{verbatim}

The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment
makes {\tt t} refer to it, but none of that has any effect
on the list that was passed as an argument.
\index{slice operator}
\index{operator!slice}

An alternative is to write a function that creates and
returns a new list.  For
example, {\tt tail} returns all but the first
element of a list:

\begin{verbatim}
def tail(t):
    return t[1:]
\end{verbatim}
%
This function leaves the original list unmodified.
Here's how it is used:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> rest = tail(letters)
>>> print rest
['b', 'c']
\end{verbatim}



\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects)
can lead to long hours of debugging.  Here are some common
pitfalls and ways to avoid them:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Don't forget that most list methods modify the argument and
  return {\tt None}.  This is the opposite of the string methods,
  which return a new string and leave the original alone.

If you are used to writing string code like this:

\begin{verbatim}
word = word.strip()
\end{verbatim}

It is tempting to write list code like this:

\begin{verbatim}
t = t.sort()           # WRONG!
\end{verbatim}
\index{sort method}
\index{method!sort}

Because {\tt sort} returns {\tt None}, the
next operation you perform with {\tt t} is likely to fail.

Before using list methods and operators, you should read the
documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode.  The
methods and operators that lists share with other sequences (like
strings) are documented at
\url{docs.python.org/lib/typesseq.html}.  The
methods and operators that only apply to mutable sequences
are documented at \url{docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-mutable.html}.


\item Pick an idiom and stick with it.

Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many
ways to do things.  For example, to remove an element from
a list, you can use {\tt pop}, {\tt remove}, {\tt del},
or even a slice assignment.

To add an element, you can use the {\tt append} method or
the {\tt +} operator.  Assuming that {\tt t} is a list and
{\tt x} is a list element, these are right: 

\begin{verbatim}
t.append(x)
t = t + [x]
\end{verbatim}

And these are wrong:

\begin{verbatim}
t.append([x])          # WRONG!
t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!
t + [x]                # WRONG!
t = t + x              # WRONG!
\end{verbatim}

Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure
you understand what they do.  Notice that only the last
one causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they
do the wrong thing.


\item Make copies to avoid aliasing.
\index{aliasing!copying to avoid}
\index{copy!to avoid aliasing}

If you want to use a method like {\tt sort} that modifies
the argument, but you need to keep the original list as
well, you can make a copy.

\begin{verbatim}
orig = t[:]
t.sort()
\end{verbatim}

In this example you could also use the built-in function {\tt sorted},
which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone.
But in that case you should avoid using {\tt sorted} as a variable
name!

\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
Write a function called \verb"is_sorted" that takes a list as a
parameter and returns {\tt True} if the list is sorted in ascending
order and {\tt False} otherwise.  You can assume (as a precondition)
that the elements of the list can be compared with the relational
operators {\tt <}, {\tt >}, etc.
\index{precondition}

For example, \verb"is_sorted([1,2,2])" should return {\tt True}
and \verb"is_sorted(['b','a'])" should return {\tt False}.

a list and returns {\tt True} if there is any element that
appears more than once.  It should not modify the original
list.
\index{birthday paradox}

Write a function that reads the file {\tt words.txt} and builds
a list with one element per word.  Write two versions of
this function, one using the {\tt append} method and the
other using the idiom {\tt t = t + [x]}.  Which one takes
longer to run?  Why?

Hint: use the {\tt time} module to measure elapsed time.

\label{bisection}
\index{membership!bisection search}
\index{bisection search}
\index{search, bisection}
\index{membership!binary search}
\index{binary search}
\index{search, binary}

To check whether a word is in the word list, you could use
the {\tt in} operator, but it would be slow because it searches
through the words in order.

Because the words are in alphabetical order, we can speed things up
with a bisection search (also known as binary search), which is
similar to what you do when you look a word up in the dictionary.  You
start in the middle and check to see whether the word you are looking
for comes before the word in the middle of the list.  If so, then you
search the first half of the list the same way.  Otherwise you search
the second half.

Either way, you cut the remaining search space in half.  If the
word list has 113,809 words, it will take about 17 steps to
find the word or conclude that it's not there.

Write a function called {\tt bisect} that takes a sorted list
and a target value and returns the index of the value
in the list, if it's there, or {\tt None} if it's not.
\index{bisect module}
\index{module!bisect}

Or you could read the documentation of the {\tt bisect} module
and use that!  Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/inlist.py}.

Two words are a ``reverse pair'' if each is the reverse of the
other.  Write a program that finds all the reverse pairs in the

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\index{interlocking words}

Two words ``interlock'' if taking alternating letters from each forms
a new word.  For example, ``shoe'' and ``cold''
interlock to form ``schooled.''
Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/interlock.py}.
Credit: This exercise is inspired by an example at \url{http://puzzlers.org}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a program that finds all pairs of words that interlock.
  Hint: don't enumerate all pairs!

\item Can you find any words that are three-way interlocked; that is,
  every third letter forms a word, starting from the first, second or
  third?

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\chapter{Dictionaries}

\index{dictionary}
\index{dictionary}
\index{type!dict}
\index{key}
\index{key-value pair}
\index{index}
A {\bf dictionary} is like a list, but more general.  In a list,
the indices have to be integers; in a dictionary they can
be (almost) any type.

You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices
(which are called {\bf keys}) and a set of values.  Each key maps to a
value.  The association of a key and a value is called a {\bf
  key-value pair} or sometimes an {\bf item}.

As an example, we'll build a dictionary that maps from English
to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.

The function {\tt dict} creates a new dictionary with no items.
Because {\tt dict} is the name of a built-in function, you
should avoid using it as a variable name.
\index{dict function}
\index{function!dict}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> eng2sp = dict()
>>> print eng2sp
{}
\end{verbatim}

The squiggly-brackets, \verb"{}", represent an empty dictionary.
To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:
\index{squiggly bracket}
\index{bracket!squiggly}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'
\end{verbatim}
%
This line creates an item that maps from the key
{\tt 'one'} to the value \verb"'uno'".  If we print the
dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon
between the key and value:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print eng2sp
{'one': 'uno'}
\end{verbatim}
%
This output format is also an input format.  For example,
you can create a new dictionary with three items:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}
\end{verbatim}
%
But if you print {\tt eng2sp}, you might be surprised:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print eng2sp
{'one': 'uno', 'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos'}
\end{verbatim}
%
The order of the key-value pairs is not the same.  In fact, if
you type the same example on your computer, you might get a
different result.  In general, the order of items in
a dictionary is unpredictable.

But that's not a problem because
the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices.
Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print eng2sp['two']
'dos'
\end{verbatim}
%
The key {\tt 'two'} always maps to the value \verb"'dos'" so the order
of the items doesn't matter.

If the key isn't in the dictionary, you get an exception:
\index{exception!KeyError}
\index{KeyError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print eng2sp['four']
KeyError: 'four'
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt len} function works on dictionaries; it returns the
number of key-value pairs:
\index{len function}
\index{function!len}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> len(eng2sp)
3
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt in} operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether
something appears as a {\em key} in the dictionary (appearing
as a value is not good enough).
\index{membership!dictionary}
\index{in operator}
\index{operator!in}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 'one' in eng2sp
True
>>> 'uno' in eng2sp
False
\end{verbatim}
%
To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you
can use the method {\tt values}, which returns the values as
a list, and then use the {\tt in} operator:
\index{values method}
\index{method!values}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> vals = eng2sp.values()
>>> 'uno' in vals
True
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt in} operator uses different algorithms for lists and
dictionaries.  For lists, it uses a search algorithm, as in
Section~\ref{find}.  As the list gets longer, the search time gets
longer in direct proportion.  For dictionaries, Python uses an
algorithm called a {\bf hashtable} that has a remarkable property: the
{\tt in} operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how
many items there are in a dictionary.  I won't explain how that's
possible, but you can read more about it at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table}.
\index{hashtable}

\begin{exercise}
\label{wordlist2}
\index{set membership}
\index{membership!set}

Write a function that reads the words in {\tt words.txt} and
stores them as keys in a dictionary.  It doesn't matter what the
values are.  Then you can use the {\tt in} operator
as a fast way to check whether a string is in
the dictionary.

If you did Exercise~\ref{wordlist1}, you can compare the speed
of this implementation with the list {\tt in} operator and the
bisection search.

\end{exercise}


\section{Dictionary as a set of counters}
\label{histogram}
\index{counter}

Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many
times each letter appears.  There are several ways you could do it:

\begin{enumerate}

\item You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the
alphabet.  Then you could traverse the string and, for each
character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using
a chained conditional.

\item You could create a list with 26 elements.  Then you could
convert each character to a number (using the built-in function
{\tt ord}), use the number as an index into the list, and increment
the appropriate counter.

\item You could create a dictionary with characters as keys
and counters as the corresponding values.  The first time you
see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary.  After
that you would increment the value of an existing item.

\end{enumerate}

Each of these options performs the same computation, but each
of them implements that computation in a different way.
\index{implementation}

An {\bf implementation} is a way of performing a computation;
some implementations are better than others.  For example,
an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we don't
have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string
and we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.

Here is what the code might look like:

\begin{verbatim}
def histogram(s):
    d = dict()
    for c in s:
        if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] += 1
    return d
\end{verbatim}
%
The name of the function is {\bf histogram}, which is a statistical
term for a set of counters (or frequencies).
\index{histogram}
\index{frequency}
\index{traversal}

The first line of the
function creates an empty dictionary.  The {\tt for} loop traverses
the string.  Each time through the loop, if the character {\tt c} is
not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key {\tt c} and the
initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once).  If {\tt c} is
already in the dictionary we increment {\tt d[c]}.
\index{histogram}

Here's how it works:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> h = histogram('brontosaurus')
>>> print h
{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 2, 'r': 2, 'u': 2, 't': 1}
\end{verbatim}
%
The histogram indicates that the letters {\tt 'a'} and \verb"'b'"
appear once; \verb"'o'" appears twice, and so on.

\begin{exercise}
\index{get method}
\index{method!get}

Dictionaries have a method called {\tt get} that takes a key
and a default value.  If the key appears in the dictionary,
{\tt get} returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns
the default value.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> h = histogram('a')
>>> print h
{'a': 1}
>>> h.get('a', 0)
1
>>> h.get('b', 0)
0
\end{verbatim}
%
Use {\tt get} to write {\tt histogram} more concisely.  You
should be able to eliminate the {\tt if} statement.
\end{exercise}


\section{Looping and dictionaries}
\index{dictionary!looping with}
\index{looping!with dictionaries}
\index{traversal}

If you use a dictionary in a {\tt for} statement, it traverses
the keys of the dictionary.  For example, \verb"print_hist"
prints each key and the corresponding value:

\begin{verbatim}
def print_hist(h):
    for c in h:
        print c, h[c]
\end{verbatim}
%
Here's what the output looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> h = histogram('parrot')
>>> print_hist(h)
a 1
p 1
r 2
t 1
o 1
\end{verbatim}
%
Again, the keys are in no particular order.

\begin{exercise}
\index{keys method}
\index{method!keys}

Dictionaries have a method called {\tt keys} that returns
the keys of the dictionary, in no particular order, as a list.

Modify \verb"print_hist" to print the keys and their values
in alphabetical order.
\end{exercise}



\section{Reverse lookup}
\label{raise}
\index{dictionary!lookup}
\index{dictionary!reverse lookup}
\index{lookup, dictionary}
\index{reverse lookup, dictionary}

Given a dictionary {\tt d} and a key {\tt k}, it is easy to
find the corresponding value {\tt v = d[k]}.  This operation
is called a {\bf lookup}.

But what if you have {\tt v} and you want to find {\tt k}?
You have two problems: first, there might be more than one
key that maps to the value {\tt v}.  Depending on the application,
you might be able to pick one, or you might have to make
a list that contains all of them.  Second, there is no
simple syntax to do a {\bf reverse lookup}; you have to search.

Here is a function that takes a value and returns the first
key that maps to that value:

\begin{verbatim}
def reverse_lookup(d, v):
    for k in d:
        if d[k] == v:
            return k
    raise ValueError
\end{verbatim}
%
This function is yet another example of the search pattern, but it
uses a feature we haven't seen before, {\tt raise}.  The {\tt raise}
statement causes an exception; in this case it causes a {\tt
  ValueError}, which generally indicates that there is something wrong
with the value of a parameter.
\index{search}
\index{pattern!search}
\index{raise statement}
\index{statement!raise}
\index{exception!ValueError}
\index{ValueError}

If we get to the end of the loop, that means {\tt v}
doesn't appear in the dictionary as a value, so we raise an
exception.

Here is an example of a successful reverse lookup:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> h = histogram('parrot')
>>> k = reverse_lookup(h, 2)
>>> print k
r
\end{verbatim}
%
And an unsuccessful one:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> k = reverse_lookup(h, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File "<stdin>", line 5, in reverse_lookup
ValueError
\end{verbatim}
%
The result when you raise an exception is the same as when
Python raises one: it prints a traceback and an error message.
\index{traceback}
\index{optional argument}
\index{argument!optional}

The {\tt raise} statement takes a detailed error message as an
optional argument.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> raise ValueError, 'value does not appear in the dictionary'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
ValueError: value does not appear in the dictionary
\end{verbatim}
%
A reverse lookup is much slower than a forward lookup; if you
have to do it often, or if the dictionary gets big, the performance
of your program will suffer.

\begin{exercise}

Modify \verb"reverse_lookup" so that it builds and returns a list
of {\em all} keys that map to {\tt v}, or an empty list if there
are none.

\end{exercise}


\section{Dictionaries and lists}
\label{invert}

Lists can appear as values in a dictionary.  For example, if you
were given a dictionary that maps from letters to frequencies, you
might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary that maps
from frequencies to letters.  Since there might be several letters
with the same frequency, each value in the inverted dictionary
should be a list of letters.
\index{invert dictionary}
\index{dictionary!invert}

Here is a function that inverts a dictionary:

\begin{verbatim}
def invert_dict(d):
    inverse = dict()
    for key in d:
        val = d[key]
        if val not in inverse:
            inverse[val] = [key]
        else:
            inverse[val].append(key)
    return inverse
\end{verbatim}
%
Each time through the loop, {\tt key} gets a key from {\tt d} and 
{\tt val} gets the corresponding value.  If {\tt val} is not in {\tt inverse},
that means we haven't seen it before, so we create a new item and
initialize it with a {\bf singleton} (a list that contains a
single element).  Otherwise we have seen this value before, so we
append the corresponding key to the list.
\index{singleton}

Here is an example:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> hist = histogram('parrot')
>>> print hist
{'a': 1, 'p': 1, 'r': 2, 't': 1, 'o': 1}
>>> inverse = invert_dict(hist)
>>> print inverse
{1: ['a', 'p', 't', 'o'], 2: ['r']}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/dict1.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.dict1}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig.dict1} is a state diagram showing {\tt hist} and {\tt inverse}.
A dictionary is represented as a box with the type {\tt dict} above it
and the key-value pairs inside.  If the values are integers, floats or
strings, I usually draw them inside the box, but I usually draw lists
outside the box, just to keep the diagram simple.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}

Lists can be values in a dictionary, as this example shows, but they
cannot be keys.  Here's what happens if you try:
\index{TypeError}
\index{exception!TypeError}


\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> d = dict()
>>> d[t] = 'oops'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
TypeError: list objects are unhashable
\end{verbatim}
%
I mentioned earlier that a dictionary is implemented using
a hashtable and that means that the keys have to be {\bf hashable}.
\index{hash function}
\index{hashable}

A {\bf hash} is a function that takes a value (of any kind)
and returns an integer.  Dictionaries use these integers,
called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs.
\index{immutability}

This system works fine if the keys are immutable.  But if the
keys are mutable, like lists, bad things happen.  For example,
when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key and 
stores it in the corresponding location.  If you modify the
key and then hash it again, it would go to a different location.
In that case you might have two entries for the same key,
or you might not be able to find a key.  Either way, the
dictionary wouldn't work correctly.

That's why the keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like
lists aren't.  The simplest way to get around this limitation is to
use tuples, which we will see in the next chapter.

Since dictionaries are mutable, they can't be used as keys,
but they {\em can} be used as values.

\begin{exercise}
Read the documentation of the dictionary method {\tt setdefault}
and use it to write a more concise version of \verb"invert_dict".
Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/invert_dict.py}.
\index{setdefault method}
\index{method!setdefault}

\end{exercise}


\section{Memos}

If you played with the {\tt fibonacci} function from
Section~\ref{one.more.example}, you might have noticed that the bigger
the argument you provide, the longer the function takes to run.
Furthermore, the run time increases very quickly.
\index{fibonacci function}
\index{function!fibonacci}

To understand why, consider Figure~\ref{fig.fibonacci}, which shows
the {\bf call graph} for {\tt fibonacci} with {\tt n=4}:

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/fibonacci.pdf}}
\caption{Call graph.}
\label{fig.fibonacci}
\end{figure}

A call graph shows a set of function frames, with lines connecting each
frame to the frames of the functions it calls.  At the top of the
graph, {\tt fibonacci} with {\tt n=4} calls {\tt fibonacci} with {\tt
n=3} and {\tt n=2}.  In turn, {\tt fibonacci} with {\tt n=3} calls
{\tt fibonacci} with {\tt n=2} and {\tt n=1}.  And so on.
\index{function frame}
\index{frame}
\index{call graph}

Count how many times {\tt fibonacci(0)} and {\tt fibonacci(1)} are
called.  This is an inefficient solution to the problem, and it gets
worse as the argument gets bigger.
\index{memo}

One solution is to keep track of values that have already been
computed by storing them in a dictionary.  A previously computed value
that is stored for later use is called a {\bf memo}.  Here is an
implementation of {\tt fibonacci} using memos:

\begin{verbatim}
known = {0:0, 1:1}

def fibonacci(n):
    if n in known:
        return known[n]

    res = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    known[n] = res
    return res
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt known} is a dictionary that keeps track of the Fibonacci
numbers we already know.  It starts with
two items: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to 1.

Whenever {\tt fibonacci} is called, it checks {\tt known}.
If the result is already there, it can return
immediately.  Otherwise it has to 
compute the new value, add it to the dictionary, and return it.

\begin{exercise}

Run this version of {\tt fibonacci} and the original with
a range of parameters and compare their run times.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

Memoize the Ackermann function from Exercise~\ref{ackermann} and see if
memoization makes it possible to evaluate the function with bigger
arguments.  Hint: no.
Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/ackermann_memo.py}.
\index{Ackermann function}
\index{function!ack}

\end{exercise}


\section{Global variables}
\index{global variable}
\index{variable!global}

In the previous example, {\tt known} is created outside the function,
so it belongs to the special frame called \verb"__main__".
Variables in \verb"__main__" are sometimes called {\bf global}
because they can be accessed from any function.  Unlike local
variables, which disappear when their function ends, global variables
persist from one function call to the next.
\index{flag}

It is common to use global variables for {\bf flags}; that is, 
boolean variables that indicate (``flag'') whether a condition
is true.  For example, some programs use
a flag named {\tt verbose} to control the level of detail in the
output:

\begin{verbatim}
verbose = True

def example1():
    if verbose:
        print 'Running example1'
\end{verbatim}
%
If you try to reassign a global variable, you might be surprised.
The following example is supposed to keep track of whether the
function has been called:
\index{multiple assignment}
\index{assignment!multiple}

\begin{verbatim}
been_called = False

def example2():
    been_called = True         # WRONG
\end{verbatim}
%
But if you run it you will see that the value of \verb"been_called"
doesn't change.  The problem is that {\tt example2} creates a new local
variable named \verb"been_called".  The local variable goes away when
the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.
\index{global statement}
\index{statement!global}
\index{declaration}

To reassign a global variable inside a function you have to
{\bf declare} the global variable before you use it:

\begin{verbatim}
been_called = False

def example2():
    global been_called 
    been_called = True
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt global} statement tells the interpreter
something like, ``In this function, when I say \verb"been_called", I
mean the global variable; don't create a local one.''
\index{update!global variable}
\index{global variable!update}

Here's an example that tries to update a global variable:

\begin{verbatim}
count = 0

def example3():
    count = count + 1          # WRONG
\end{verbatim}
%
If you run it you get:
\index{UnboundLocalError}
\index{exception!UnboundLocalError}

\begin{verbatim}
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'count' referenced before assignment
\end{verbatim}
%
Python assumes that {\tt count} is local, which means
that you are reading it before writing it.  The solution, again,
is to declare {\tt count} global.
\index{counter}

\begin{verbatim}
def example3():
    global count
    count += 1
\end{verbatim}
%
If the global value is mutable, you can modify it without
declaring it:
\index{mutability}

\begin{verbatim}
known = {0:0, 1:1}

def example4():
    known[2] = 1
\end{verbatim}
%
So you can add, remove and replace elements of a global list or
dictionary, but if you want to reassign the variable, you
have to declare it:

\begin{verbatim}
def example5():
    global known
    known = dict()
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Long integers}
\index{long integer}
\index{integer!long}
\index{type!long}

If you compute {\tt fibonacci(50)}, you get:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fibonacci(50)
12586269025L
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt L} at the end indicates that the result is a long
integer, or type {\tt long}.  In Python 3, {\tt long} is gone; all integers,
even really big ones, are type {\tt int}.
\index{Python 3}

Values with type {\tt int} have a limited range;
long integers can be arbitrarily big, but as they get bigger
they consume more space and time.

The mathematical operators work on long integers, and the functions
in the {\tt math} module, too, so in general any code that
works with {\tt int} will also work with {\tt long}.

Any time the result of a computation is too big to be represented with
an integer, Python converts the result as a long integer:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 1000 * 1000
1000000
>>> 100000 * 100000
10000000000L
\end{verbatim}
%
In the first case the result has type {\tt int}; in the
second case it is {\tt long}.

\begin{exercise}
\index{encryption}
\index{RSA algorithm}
\index{algorithm!RSA}

Exponentiation of large integers is the basis of common
algorithms for public-key encryption.  Read the Wikipedia
page on the RSA algorithm (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA})
and write functions to encode and decode messages.

% TODO: solution for this one!

\end{exercise}


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to
debug by printing and checking data by hand.  Here are some
suggestions for debugging large datasets:

\begin{description}

\item[Scale down the input:] If possible, reduce the size of the
dataset.  For example if the program reads a text file, start with
just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find.
You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the
program so it reads only the first {\tt n} lines.

If there is an error, you can reduce {\tt n} to the smallest
value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually
as you find and correct errors.

\item[Check summaries and types:] Instead of printing and checking the
entire dataset, consider printing summaries of the data: for example,
the number of items in a dictionary or the total of a list of numbers.

A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right
type.  For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print
the type of a value.

\item[Write self-checks:]  Sometimes you can write code to check
for errors automatically.  For example, if you are computing the
average of a list of numbers, you could check that the result is
not greater than the largest element in the list or less than
the smallest.  This is called a ``sanity check'' because it detects
results that are ``insane.''
\index{sanity check}
\index{consistency check}

Another kind of check compares the results of two different
computations to see if they are consistent.  This is called a
``consistency check.''

\item[Pretty print the output:] Formatting debugging output
can make it easier to spot an error.  We saw an example in
Section~\ref{factdebug}.  The {\tt pprint} module provides
a {\tt pprint} function that displays built-in types in
a more human-readable format.
\index{pretty print}
\index{pprint module}
\index{module!pprint}

\end{description}

Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce
the time you spend debugging.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
\index{duplicate}

If you did Exercise~\ref{duplicate}, you already have
a function named \verb"has_duplicates" that takes a list

that appears more than once in the list.

Use a dictionary to write a faster, simpler version of
\verb"has_duplicates".

\begin{exercise}
\index{Car Talk}
\index{Puzzler}

Here's another Puzzler from {\em Car
Talk} (\url{http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/200717}):

\begin{quote}
This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O'Leary. He came upon a common
one-syllable, five-letter word recently that has the following unique
property. When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form
a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly
the same. Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove
the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the
original word. And the question is, what's the word?

Now I'm going to give you an example that doesn't work. Let's look at
the five-letter word, `wrack.' W-R-A-C-K, you know like to `wrack with
pain.' If I remove the first letter, I am left with a four-letter
word, 'R-A-C-K.' As in, `Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck!
It must have been a nine-pointer!' It's a perfect homophone. If you
put the `w' back, and remove the `r,' instead, you're left with the
word, `wack,' which is a real word, it's just not a homophone of the
other two words.

But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of,
which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two
letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what's
the word?
\end{quote}
\index{homophone}
\index{reducible word}
\index{word, reducible}

You can use the dictionary from Exercise~\ref{wordlist2} to check
whether a string is in the word list.

To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU
Pronouncing Dictionary.  You can download it from
\url{http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict} or from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/c06d} and you can also download
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/pronounce.py}, which provides a function
named \verb"read_dictionary" that reads the pronouncing dictionary and
returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string that
describes its primary pronunciation.

Write a program that lists all the words that solve the Puzzler.
Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/homophone.py}.

\end{exercise}



\chapter{Tuples}
\label{tuplechap}

\section{Tuples are immutable}
\index{tuple}
\index{type!tuple}
\index{sequence}

A tuple is a sequence of values.  The values can be any type, and
they are indexed by integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot
like lists.  The important difference is that tuples are immutable.
\index{mutability}
\index{immutability}

Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
\end{verbatim}
%
Although it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in
parentheses:
\index{parentheses!tuples in}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
\end{verbatim}
%
To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include a final
comma:
\index{singleton}
\index{tuple!singleton}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t1 = 'a',
>>> type(t1)
<type 'tuple'>
\end{verbatim}
%
A value in parentheses is not a tuple:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t2 = ('a')
>>> type(t2)
<type 'str'>
\end{verbatim}
%
Another way to create a tuple is the built-in function {\tt tuple}.
With no argument, it creates an empty tuple:
\index{tuple function}
\index{function!tuple}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = tuple()
>>> print t
()
\end{verbatim}
%
If the argument is a sequence (string, list or tuple), the result
is a tuple with the elements of the sequence:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = tuple('lupins')
>>> print t
('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')
\end{verbatim}
%
Because {\tt tuple} is the name of a built-in function, you should
avoid using it as a variable name.

Most list operators also work on tuples.  The bracket operator
indexes an element:
\index{bracket operator}
\index{operator!bracket}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
>>> print t[0]
'a'
\end{verbatim}
%
And the slice operator selects a range of elements.
\index{slice operator}
\index{operator!slice}
\index{tuple!slice}
\index{slice!tuple}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print t[1:3]
('b', 'c')
\end{verbatim}
%
But if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get
an error:
\index{exception!TypeError}
\index{TypeError}
\index{item assignment}
\index{assignment!item}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t[0] = 'A'
TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment
\end{verbatim}
%
You can't modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace
one tuple with another:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ('A',) + t[1:]
>>> print t
('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Tuple assignment}
\label{tuple.assignment}
\index{tuple!assignment}
\index{assignment!tuple}
\index{swap pattern}
\index{pattern!swap}

It is often useful to swap the values of two variables.
With conventional assignments, you have to use a temporary
variable.  For example, to swap {\tt a} and {\tt b}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> temp = a
>>> a = b
>>> b = temp
\end{verbatim}
%
This solution is cumbersome; {\bf tuple assignment} is more elegant:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> a, b = b, a
\end{verbatim}
%
The left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of
expressions.  Each value is assigned to its respective variable.  
All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any
of the assignments.

The number of variables on the left and the number of
values on the right have to be the same:
\index{exception!ValueError}
\index{ValueError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> a, b = 1, 2, 3
ValueError: too many values to unpack
\end{verbatim}
%
More generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence
(string, list or tuple).  For example, to split an email address
into a user name and a domain, you could write:
\index{split method}
\index{method!split}
\index{email address}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> addr = 'monty@python.org'
>>> uname, domain = addr.split('@')
\end{verbatim}
%
The return value from {\tt split} is a list with two elements;
the first element is assigned to {\tt uname}, the second to
{\tt domain}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print uname
monty
>>> print domain
python.org
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Tuples as return values}
\index{tuple}
\index{value!tuple}
\index{return value!tuple}
\index{function, tuple as return value}

Strictly speaking, a function can only return one value, but
if the value is a tuple, the effect is the same as returning
multiple values.  For example, if you want to divide two integers
and compute the quotient and remainder, it is inefficient to
compute {\tt x/y} and then {\tt x\%y}.  It is better to compute
them both at the same time.
\index{divmod}

The built-in function {\tt divmod} takes two arguments and
returns a tuple of two values, the quotient and remainder.
You can store the result as a tuple:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = divmod(7, 3)
>>> print t
(2, 1)
\end{verbatim}
%
Or use tuple assignment to store the elements separately:
\index{tuple assignment}
\index{assignment!tuple}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> quot, rem = divmod(7, 3)
>>> print quot
2
>>> print rem
1
\end{verbatim}
%
Here is an example of a function that returns a tuple:

\begin{verbatim}
def min_max(t):
    return min(t), max(t)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt max} and {\tt min} are built-in functions that find
the largest and smallest elements of a sequence.  \verb"min_max"
computes both and returns a tuple of two values.
\index{max function}
\index{function!max}
\index{min function}
\index{function!min}


\section{Variable-length argument tuples}
\index{variable-length argument tuple}
\index{argument!variable-length tuple}
\index{gather}
\index{parameter!gather}
\index{argument!gather}

Functions can take a variable number of arguments.  A parameter
name that begins with {\tt *} {\bf gathers} arguments into
a tuple.  For example, {\tt printall}
takes any number of arguments and prints them:

\begin{verbatim}
def printall(*args):
    print args
\end{verbatim}
%
The gather parameter can have any name you like, but {\tt args} is
conventional.  Here's how the function works:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> printall(1, 2.0, '3')
(1, 2.0, '3')
\end{verbatim}
%
The complement of gather is {\bf scatter}.  If you have a
sequence of values and you want to pass it to a function
as multiple arguments, you can use the {\tt *} operator.
For example, {\tt divmod} takes exactly two arguments; it
doesn't work with a tuple:

% removing this because we haven't seen optional parameters yet
%You can combine the gather operator with required and positional
%arguments:

%%\begin{verbatim}
%def pointless(required, optional=0, *args):
%    print required, optional, args
%\end{verbatim}
%\afterverb
%
%Run this function with 1, 2, 3 and 4 or more arguments and
%make sure you understand what it does.
\index{scatter}
\index{argument scatter}
\index{TypeError}
\index{exception!TypeError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = (7, 3)
>>> divmod(t)
TypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1
\end{verbatim}
%
But if you scatter the tuple, it works:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> divmod(*t)
(2, 1)
\end{verbatim}
%
\begin{exercise}

Many of the built-in functions use
variable-length argument tuples.  For example, {\tt max}
and {\tt min} can take any number of arguments:
\index{max function}
\index{function!max}
\index{min function}
\index{function!min}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> max(1,2,3)
3
\end{verbatim}
%
But {\tt sum} does not.
\index{sum function}
\index{function!sum}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> sum(1,2,3)
TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3
\end{verbatim}
%
Write a function called {\tt sumall} that takes any number
of arguments and returns their sum.

\end{exercise}


\section{Lists and tuples}
\index{zip function}
\index{function!zip}

{\tt zip} is a built-in function that takes two or more sequences and
``zips'' them into a list of tuples where each tuple contains one
element from each sequence.  In Python 3, {\tt zip} returns an iterator
of tuples, but for most purposes, an iterator behaves like a list.
\index{Python 3}

This example zips a string and a list:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> t = [0, 1, 2]
>>> zip(s, t)
[('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)]
\end{verbatim}
%
The result is a list of tuples where each tuple contains
a character from the string and the corresponding element from
the list.
\index{list!of tuples}

If the sequences are not the same length, the result has the
length of the shorter one.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> zip('Anne', 'Elk')
[('A', 'E'), ('n', 'l'), ('n', 'k')]
\end{verbatim}
%
You can use tuple assignment in a {\tt for} loop to traverse a list of
tuples:
\index{traversal}
\index{tuple assignment}
\index{assignment!tuple}

\begin{verbatim}
t = [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)]
for letter, number in t:
    print number, letter
\end{verbatim}
%
Each time through the loop, Python selects the next tuple in
the list and assigns the elements to {\tt letter} and 
{\tt number}.  The output of this loop is:
\index{loop}

\begin{verbatim}
0 a
1 b
2 c
\end{verbatim}
%
If you combine {\tt zip}, {\tt for} and tuple assignment, you get a
useful idiom for traversing two (or more) sequences at the same
time.  For example, \verb"has_match" takes two sequences, {\tt t1} and
{\tt t2}, and returns {\tt True} if there is an index {\tt i}
such that {\tt t1[i] == t2[i]}:
\index{for loop}

\begin{verbatim}
def has_match(t1, t2):
    for x, y in zip(t1, t2):
        if x == y:
            return True
    return False
\end{verbatim}
%
If you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their
indices, you can use the built-in function {\tt enumerate}:
\index{traversal}
\index{enumerate function}
\index{function!enumerate}

\begin{verbatim}
for index, element in enumerate('abc'):
    print index, element
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of this loop is:

\begin{verbatim}
0 a
1 b
2 c
\end{verbatim}
%
Again.


\section{Dictionaries and tuples}
\label{dictuple}
\index{dictionary}
\index{items method}
\index{method!items}
\index{key-value pair}

Dictionaries have a method called {\tt items} that returns a list of
tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> d = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2}
>>> t = d.items()
>>> print t
[('a', 0), ('c', 2), ('b', 1)]
\end{verbatim}
%
As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no
particular order.  In Python 3, {\tt items} returns an iterator,
but for many purposes, iterators behave like lists.

Going in the other direction, you can use a list of tuples to
initialize a new dictionary: \index{dictionary!initialize}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = [('a', 0), ('c', 2), ('b', 1)]
>>> d = dict(t)
>>> print d
{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1}
\end{verbatim}

Combining {\tt dict} with {\tt zip} yields a concise way
to create a dictionary:
\index{zip function!use with dict}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> d = dict(zip('abc', range(3)))
>>> print d
{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1}
\end{verbatim}
%
The dictionary method {\tt update} also takes a list of tuples
and adds them, as key-value pairs, to an existing dictionary.
\index{update method}
\index{method!update}
\index{traverse!dictionary}
\index{dictionary!traversal}

Combining {\tt items}, tuple assignment and {\tt for}, you
get the idiom for traversing the keys and values of a dictionary:

\begin{verbatim}
for key, val in d.items():
    print val, key
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of this loop is:

\begin{verbatim}
0 a
2 c
1 b
\end{verbatim}
%
Again.

It is common to use tuples as keys in dictionaries (primarily because
you can't use lists).  For example, a telephone directory might map
from last-name, first-name pairs to telephone numbers.  Assuming
that we have defined {\tt last}, {\tt first} and {\tt number}, we
could write:
\index{tuple!as key in dictionary}
\index{hashable}

\begin{verbatim}
directory[last,first] = number
\end{verbatim}
%
The expression in brackets is a tuple.  We could use tuple
assignment to traverse this dictionary.
\index{tuple!in brackets}

\begin{verbatim}
for last, first in directory:
    print first, last, directory[last,first]
\end{verbatim}
%
This loop traverses the keys in {\tt directory}, which are tuples.  It
assigns the elements of each tuple to {\tt last} and {\tt first}, then
prints the name and corresponding telephone number.

There are two ways to represent tuples in a state diagram.  The more
detailed version shows the indices and elements just as they appear in
a list.  For example, the tuple \verb"('Cleese', 'John')" would appear
as in Figure~\ref{fig.tuple1}.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/tuple1.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.tuple1}
\end{figure}

But in a larger diagram you might want to leave out the
details.  For example, a diagram of the telephone directory might
appear as in Figure~\ref{fig.dict2}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/dict2.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram.}
\label{fig.dict2}
\end{figure}

Here the tuples are shown using Python syntax as a graphical
shorthand.

The telephone number in the diagram is the complaints line for the
BBC, so please don't call it.



\section{Comparing tuples}
\index{comparison!tuple}
\index{tuple!comparison}
\index{sort method}
\index{method!sort}

The relational operators work with tuples and other sequences;
Python starts by comparing the first element from each
sequence.  If they are equal, it goes on to the next elements,
and so on, until it finds elements that differ.  Subsequent
elements are not considered (even if they are really big).

\begin{verbatim}
>>> (0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4)
True
>>> (0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4)
True
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt sort} function works the same way.  It sorts 
primarily by first element, but in the case of a tie, it sorts
by second element, and so on.  

This feature lends itself to a pattern called {\bf DSU} for 

\begin{description}

\item[Decorate] a sequence by building a list of tuples
with one or more sort keys preceding the elements from the sequence,

\item[Sort] the list of tuples, and

\item[Undecorate] by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.

\end{description}

\label{DSU}
\index{DSU pattern}
\index{pattern!DSU}
\index{decorate-sort-undecorate pattern}
\index{pattern!decorate-sort-undecorate}

For example, suppose you have a list of words and you want to
sort them from longest to shortest:

\begin{verbatim}
def sort_by_length(words):
    t = []
    for word in words:
       t.append((len(word), word))

    t.sort(reverse=True)

    res = []
    for length, word in t:
        res.append(word)
    return res
\end{verbatim}
%
The first loop builds a list of tuples, where each
tuple is a word preceded by its length.

{\tt sort} compares the first element, length, first, and
only considers the second element to break ties.  The keyword argument
{\tt reverse=True} tells {\tt sort} to go in decreasing order.
\index{keyword argument}
\index{argument!keyword}
\index{traversal}

The second loop traverses the list of tuples and builds a list of
words in descending order of length.

\begin{exercise}

In this example, ties are broken by comparing words, so words
with the same length appear in reverse alphabetical order.  For other
applications you might want to break ties at random.  Modify
this example so that words with the same length appear in
random order.  Hint: see the {\tt random} function in the
{\tt random} module.
Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/unstable_sort.py}.

\index{random module}
\index{module!random}
\index{random function}
\index{function!random}

\end{exercise}


\section{Sequences of sequences}
\index{sequence}

I have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in
this chapter also work with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and
tuples of lists.  To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it
is sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences.

In many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists and
tuples) can be used interchangeably.  So how and why do you choose one
over the others?
\index{string}
\index{list}
\index{tuple}
\index{mutability}
\index{immutability}

To start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other
sequences because the elements have to be characters.  They are
also immutable.  If you need the ability to change the characters
in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might
want to use a list of characters instead.

Lists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable.
But there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples:

\begin{enumerate}

\item In some contexts, like a {\tt return} statement, it is
syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list.  In other
contexts, you might prefer a list.

\item If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you
have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string.

\item If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function,
using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior
due to aliasing.

\end{enumerate}

Because tuples are immutable, they don't provide methods
like {\tt sort} and {\tt reverse}, which modify existing lists.
But Python provides the built-in functions {\tt sorted}
and {\tt reversed}, which take any sequence as a parameter
and return a new list with the same elements in a different
order.
\index{sorted function}
\index{function!sorted}
\index{reversed function}
\index{function!reversed}


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}
\index{data structure}
\index{shape error}
\index{error!shape}

Lists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as {\bf data
  structures}; in this chapter we are starting to see compound data
structures, like lists of tuples, and dictionaries that contain tuples
as keys and lists as values.  Compound data structures are useful, but
they are prone to what I call {\bf shape errors}; that is, errors
caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size or composition.
For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I
give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won't work.
\index{structshape module}
\index{module!structshape}

% TODO: structshape is now part of Swampy

To help debug these kinds of errors, I have written a module
called {\tt structshape} that provides a function, also called
{\tt structshape}, that takes any kind of data structure as
an argument and returns a string that summarizes its shape.
You can download it from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/structshape.py}

Here's the result for a simple list:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from structshape import structshape
>>> t = [1,2,3]
>>> print structshape(t)
list of 3 int
\end{verbatim}
%
A fancier program might write ``list of 3 int{\em s},'' but it
was easier not to deal with plurals.  Here's a list of lists:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t2 = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
>>> print structshape(t2)
list of 3 list of 2 int
\end{verbatim}
%
If the elements of the list are not the same type,
{\tt structshape} groups them, in order, by type:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t3 = [1, 2, 3, 4.0, '5', '6', [7], [8], 9]
>>> print structshape(t3)
list of (3 int, float, 2 str, 2 list of int, int)
\end{verbatim}
%
Here's a list of tuples:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> s = 'abc'
>>> lt = zip(t, s)
>>> print structshape(lt)
list of 3 tuple of (int, str)
\end{verbatim}
%
And here's a dictionary with 3 items that map integers to strings.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> d = dict(lt) 
>>> print structshape(d)
dict of 3 int->str
\end{verbatim}
%
If you are having trouble keeping track of your data structures,
{\tt structshape} can help.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}

Write a function called \verb"most_frequent" that takes a string and
prints the letters in decreasing order of frequency.  Find text
samples from several different languages and see how letter frequency
varies between languages.  Compare your results with the tables at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies}.  Solution:
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/most_frequenct.py}.  \index{letter
  frequency} \index{frequency!letter}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{anagrams}
\index{anagram set}
\index{set!anagram}

More anagrams!

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a program
that reads a word list from a file (see Section~\ref{wordlist}) and
prints all the sets of words that are anagrams.

Here is an example of what the output might look like:

\begin{verbatim}
['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled']
['retainers', 'ternaries']
['generating', 'greatening']
['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless']
\end{verbatim}
%
Hint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a
set of letters to a list of words that can be spelled with those
letters.  The question is, how can you represent the set of
letters in a way that can be used as a key?

\item Modify the previous program so that it prints the largest set
of anagrams first, followed by the second largest set, and so on.
\index{Scrabble}
\index{bingo}

\item In Scrabble a ``bingo'' is when you play all seven tiles in
your rack, along with a letter on the board, to form an eight-letter
word.  What set of 8 letters forms the most possible bingos?
Hint: there are seven.

% (7, ['angriest', 'astringe', 'ganister', 'gantries', 'granites',
% 'ingrates', 'rangiest'])

Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/anagram_sets.py}.

\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\index{metathesis}

Two words form a ``metathesis pair'' if you can transform one into the
other by swapping two letters; for example, ``converse'' and
``conserve.''  Write a program that finds all of the metathesis pairs
in the dictionary.  Hint: don't test all pairs of words, and don't
test all possible swaps.  Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/metathesis.py}.

\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
\index{Car Talk}
\index{Puzzler}

Here's another Car Talk Puzzler
(\url{http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/transcripts/200651}):

\begin{quote}
What is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word,
as you remove its letters one at a time?

Now, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you
can't rearrange any of the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you
wind up with another English word. If you do that, you're eventually
going to wind up with one letter and that too is going to be an
English word---one that's found in the dictionary. I want to know
what's the longest word and how many letters does it
have?

I'm going to give you a little modest example: Sprite. Ok? You start
off with sprite, you take a letter off, one from the interior of the
word, take the r away, and we're left with the word spite, then we
take the e off the end, we're left with spit, we take the s off, we're
left with pit, it, and I.
\end{quote}
\index{reducible word}
\index{word, reducible}

Write a program to find all words that can be reduced in this way,
and then find the longest one.

This exercise is a little more challenging than most, so here are
some suggestions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item You might want to write a function that takes a word and
  computes a list of all the words that can be formed by removing one
  letter.  These are the ``children'' of the word.
\index{recursive definition}
\index{definition!recursive}

\item Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children
are reducible.  As a base case, you can consider the empty
string reducible.

\item The wordlist I provided, {\tt words.txt}, doesn't
contain single letter words.  So you might want to add
``I'', ``a'', and the empty string.

\item To improve the performance of your program, you might want
to memoize the words that are known to be reducible.

\end{enumerate}

Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/reducible.py}.

\chapter{Case study: data structure selection}

\section{Word frequency analysis}
\label{analysis}

As usual, you should at least attempt the following exercises
before you read my solutions.

\begin{exercise}

Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into
words, strips whitespace and punctuation from the words, and
converts them to lowercase.
\index{string module}
\index{module!string}

Hint: The {\tt string} module provides strings named {\tt whitespace},
which contains space, tab, newline, etc., and {\tt
  punctuation} which contains the punctuation characters.  Let's see
if we can make Python swear:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import string
>>> print string.punctuation
!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
\end{verbatim}
%
Also, you might consider using the string methods {\tt strip},
{\tt replace} and {\tt translate}.
\index{strip method}
\index{method!strip}
\index{replace method}
\index{method!replace}
\index{translate method}
\index{method!translate}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\index{Project Gutenberg}

Go to Project Gutenberg (\url{gutenberg.org}) and download 
your favorite out-of-copyright book in plain text format.
\index{plain text}
\index{text!plain}

Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book
you downloaded, skip over the header information at the beginning
of the file, and process the rest of the words as before.

Then modify the program to count the total number of words in
the book, and the number of times each word is used.
\index{word frequency}
\index{frequency!word}

Print the number of different words used in the book.  Compare
different books by different authors, written in different eras.
Which author uses the most extensive vocabulary?
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the
20 most frequently-used words in the book.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Modify the previous program to read a word list (see
Section~\ref{wordlist}) and then print all the words in the book that
are not in the word list.  How many of them are typos?  How many of
them are common words that {\em should} be in the word list, and how
many of them are really obscure?

\end{exercise}


\section{Random numbers}
\index{random number}
\index{number, random}
\index{deterministic}
\index{pseudorandom}

Given the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same
outputs every time, so they are said to be {\bf deterministic}.
Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect the same
calculation to yield the same result.  For some applications, though,
we want the computer to be unpredictable.  Games are an obvious
example, but there are more.

Making a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be not so easy,
but there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic.  One of
them is to use algorithms that generate {\bf pseudorandom} numbers.
Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random because they are generated
by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it
is all but impossible to distinguish them from random.
\index{random module}
\index{module!random}

The {\tt random} module provides functions that generate
pseudorandom numbers (which I will simply call ``random'' from
here on).
\index{random function}
\index{function!random}

The function {\tt random} returns a random float
between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0).  Each time you
call {\tt random}, you get the next number in a long series.  To see a
sample, run this loop:

\begin{verbatim}
import random

for i in range(10):
    x = random.random()
    print x
\end{verbatim}
%
The function {\tt randint} takes parameters {\tt low} and
{\tt high} and returns an integer between {\tt low} and
{\tt high} (including both).
\index{randint function}
\index{function!randint}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
5
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
9
\end{verbatim}
%
To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use
{\tt choice}:
\index{choice function}
\index{function!choice}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> random.choice(t)
2
>>> random.choice(t)
3
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt random} module also provides functions to generate
random values from continuous distributions including
Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more.

\begin{exercise}
\index{histogram!random choice}

Write a function named \verb"choose_from_hist" that takes
a histogram as defined in Section~\ref{histogram} and returns a 
random value from the histogram, chosen with probability
in proportion to frequency.  For example, for this histogram:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['a', 'a', 'b']
>>> hist = histogram(t)
>>> print hist
{'a': 2, 'b': 1}
\end{verbatim}
%
your function should return {\tt 'a'} with probability $2/3$ and {\tt 'b'}
with probability $1/3$.
\end{exercise}


\section{Word histogram}

You should attempt the previous exercises before you go on.
You can download my solution from
 \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/analyze_book.py}.  You will
also need \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/emma.txt}.

Here is a program that reads a file and builds a histogram of the
words in the file:
\index{histogram!word frequencies}

\begin{verbatim}
import string

def process_file(filename):
    hist = dict()
    fp = open(filename)
    for line in fp:
        process_line(line, hist)
    return hist

def process_line(line, hist):
    line = line.replace('-', ' ')
    
    for word in line.split():
        word = word.strip(string.punctuation + string.whitespace)
        word = word.lower()

        hist[word] = hist.get(word, 0) + 1

hist = process_file('emma.txt')
\end{verbatim}
%
This program reads {\tt emma.txt}, which contains the text of {\em
  Emma} by Jane Austen.
\index{Austin, Jane}

\verb"process_file" loops through the lines of the file,
passing them one at a time to \verb"process_line".  The histogram
{\tt hist} is being used as an accumulator.
\index{accumulator!histogram}
\index{traversal}

\verb"process_line" uses the string method {\tt replace} to replace
hyphens with spaces before using {\tt split} to break the line into a
list of strings.  It traverses the list of words and uses {\tt strip}
and {\tt lower} to remove punctuation and convert to lower case.  (It
is a shorthand to say that strings are ``converted;'' remember that
string are immutable, so methods like {\tt strip} and {\tt lower}
return new strings.)

Finally, \verb"process_line" updates the histogram by creating a new
item or incrementing an existing one.
\index{update!histogram}

To count the total number of words in the file, we can add up
the frequencies in the histogram:

\begin{verbatim}
def total_words(hist):
    return sum(hist.values())
\end{verbatim}
%
The number of different words is just the number of items in
the dictionary:

\begin{verbatim}
def different_words(hist):
    return len(hist)
\end{verbatim}
%
Here is some code to print the results:

\begin{verbatim}
print 'Total number of words:', total_words(hist)
print 'Number of different words:', different_words(hist)
\end{verbatim}
%
And the results:

\begin{verbatim}
Total number of words: 161080
Number of different words: 7214
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Most common words}
\index{DSU pattern}
\index{pattern!DSU}

To find the most common words, we can apply the DSU pattern;
\verb"most_common" takes a histogram and returns a list of
word-frequency tuples, sorted in reverse order by frequency:

\begin{verbatim}
def most_common(hist):
    t = []
    for key, value in hist.items():
        t.append((value, key))

    t.sort(reverse=True)
    return t
\end{verbatim}
%
Here is a loop that prints the ten most common words:

\begin{verbatim}
t = most_common(hist)
print 'The most common words are:'
for freq, word in t[0:10]:
    print word, '\t', freq
\end{verbatim}
%
And here are the results from {\em Emma}:

\begin{verbatim}
The most common words are:
to 	5242
the 	5205
and 	4897
of 	4295
i 	3191
a 	3130
it 	2529
her 	2483
was 	2400
she 	2364
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Optional parameters}
\index{optional parameter}
\index{parameter!optional}

We have seen built-in functions and methods that take a variable
number of arguments.  It is possible to write user-defined functions
with optional arguments, too.  For example, here is a function that
prints the most common words in a histogram

\begin{verbatim}
def print_most_common(hist, num=10):
    t = most_common(hist)
    print 'The most common words are:'
    for freq, word in t[:num]:
        print word, '\t', freq
\end{verbatim}

The first parameter is required; the second is optional.
The {\bf default value} of {\tt num} is 10.
\index{default value}
\index{value!default}

If you only provide one argument:

\begin{verbatim}
print_most_common(hist)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt num} gets the default value.  If you provide two arguments:

\begin{verbatim}
print_most_common(hist, 20)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt num} gets the value of the argument instead.  In other
words, the optional argument {\bf overrides} the default value.
\index{override}

If a function has both required and optional parameters, all
the required parameters have to come first, followed by the
optional ones.


\section{Dictionary subtraction}
\index{dictionary!subtraction}
\index{subtraction!dictionary}

Finding the words from the book that are not in the word list
from {\tt words.txt} is a problem you might recognize as set
subtraction; that is, we want to find all the words from one
set (the words in the book) that are not in another set (the
words in the list).

{\tt subtract} takes dictionaries {\tt d1} and {\tt d2} and returns a
new dictionary that contains all the keys from {\tt d1} that are not
in {\tt d2}.  Since we don't really care about the values, we
set them all to None.

\begin{verbatim}
def subtract(d1, d2):
    res = dict()
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            res[key] = None
    return res
\end{verbatim}
%
To find the words in the book that are not in {\tt words.txt},
we can use \verb"process_file" to build a histogram for
{\tt words.txt}, and then subtract:

\begin{verbatim}
words = process_file('words.txt')
diff = subtract(hist, words)

print "The words in the book that aren't in the word list are:"
for word in diff.keys():
    print word,
\end{verbatim}
%
Here are some of the results from {\em Emma}:

\begin{verbatim}
The words in the book that aren't in the word list are:
 rencontre jane's blanche woodhouses disingenuousness 
friend's venice apartment ...
\end{verbatim}
%
Some of these words are names and possessives.  Others, like
``rencontre,'' are no longer in common use.  But a few are common
words that should really be in the list!

\begin{exercise}
\index{set}
\index{type!set}

Python provides a data structure called {\tt set} that provides many
common set operations.  Read the documentation at
\url{http://docs.python.org/lib/types-set.html} and write a program
that uses set subtraction to find words in the book that are not in
the word list.  Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/analyze_book2.py}.

\end{exercise}


\section{Random words}
\label{randomwords}
\index{histogram!random choice}

To choose a random word from the histogram, the simplest algorithm
is to build a list with multiple copies of each word, according
to the observed frequency, and then choose from the list:

\begin{verbatim}
def random_word(h):
    t = []
    for word, freq in h.items():
        t.extend([word] * freq)

    return random.choice(t)
\end{verbatim}
%
The expression {\tt [word] * freq} creates a list with {\tt freq}
copies of the string {\tt word}.  The {\tt extend}
method is similar to {\tt append} except that the argument is
a sequence.

\begin{exercise}
\label{randhist}
\index{algorithm}

This algorithm works, but it is not very efficient; each time you
choose a random word, it rebuilds the list, which is as big as
the original book.  An obvious improvement is to build the list
once and then make multiple selections, but the list is still big.

An alternative is:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use {\tt keys} to get a list of the words in the book.

\item Build a list that contains the cumulative sum of the word
  frequencies (see Exercise~\ref{cumulative}).  The last item
  in this list is the total number of words in the book, $n$.
  
\item Choose a random number from 1 to $n$.  Use a bisection search
  (See Exercise~\ref{bisection}) to find the index where the random
  number would be inserted in the cumulative sum.

\item Use the index to find the corresponding word in the word list.

\end{enumerate}

Write a program that uses this algorithm to choose a random
word from the book.  Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/analyze_book3.py}.

\end{exercise}



\section{Markov analysis}
\label{markov}
\index{Markov analysis}

If you choose words from the book at random, you can get a
sense of the vocabulary, you probably won't get a sentence:

\begin{verbatim}
this the small regard harriet which knightley's it most things
\end{verbatim}
%
A series of random words seldom makes sense because there
is no relationship between successive words.  For example, in
a real sentence you would expect an article like ``the'' to
be followed by an adjective or a noun, and probably not a verb
or adverb.

One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov
analysis, which
characterizes, for a given sequence of words, the probability of the
word that comes next.  For example, the song {\em Eric, the Half a
  Bee} begins:

\begin{quote}
Half a bee, philosophically, \\
Must, ipso facto, half not be. \\
But half the bee has got to be \\
Vis a vis, its entity. D'you see? \\
\\
But can a bee be said to be \\
Or not to be an entire bee \\
When half the bee is not a bee \\
Due to some ancient injury? \\
\end{quote}
%
In this text,
the phrase ``half the'' is always followed by the word ``bee,''
but the phrase ``the bee'' might be followed by either
``has'' or ``is''.
\index{prefix}
\index{suffix}
\index{mapping}

The result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each prefix
(like ``half the'' and ``the bee'') to all possible suffixes
(like ``has'' and ``is'').
\index{random text}
\index{text!random}

Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by
starting with any prefix and choosing at random from the
possible suffixes.  Next, you can combine the end of the
prefix and the new suffix to form the next prefix, and repeat.

For example, if you start with the prefix ``Half a,'' then the
next word has to be ``bee,'' because the prefix only appears
once in the text.  The next prefix is ``a bee,'' so the
next suffix might be ``philosophically,'' ``be'' or ``due.''

In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but
you can do Markov analysis with any prefix length.  The length
of the prefix is called the ``order'' of the analysis.

\begin{exercise}

Markov analysis:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov
analysis.  The result should be a dictionary that maps from
prefixes to a collection of possible suffixes.  The collection
might be a list, tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make
an appropriate choice.  You can test your program with prefix
length two, but you should write the program in a way that makes
it easy to try other lengths.

\item Add a function to the previous program to generate random text
based on the Markov analysis.  Here is an example from {\em Emma}
with prefix length 2:

\begin{quote}
He was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only
amused, at such a stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till you
were never meant for me?" "I cannot make speeches, Emma:" he soon cut
it all himself.
\end{quote}

For this example, I left the punctuation attached to the words.
The result is almost syntactically correct, but not quite.
Semantically, it almost makes sense, but not quite.

What happens if you increase the prefix length?  Does the random
text make more sense?
\index{mash-up}

\item Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up:
if you analyze text from two or more books, the random
text you generate will blend the vocabulary and phrases from
the sources in interesting ways.

\end{enumerate}

Credit: This case study is based on an example from Kernighan and
Pike, {\em The Practice of Programming}, Addison-Wesley, 1999.

\end{exercise}

You should attempt this exercise before you go on; then you can can

will also need \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/emma.txt}.


\section{Data structures}
\index{data structure}

Using Markov analysis to generate random text is fun, but there is
also a point to this exercise: data structure selection.  In your
solution to the previous exercises, you had to choose:

\begin{itemize}

\item How to represent the prefixes.

\item How to represent the collection of possible suffixes.

\item How to represent the mapping from each prefix to
the collection of possible suffixes.

\end{itemize}

Ok, the last one is the easy; the only mapping type we have
seen is a dictionary, so it is the natural choice.

For the prefixes, the most obvious options are string,
list of strings, or tuple of strings.  For the suffixes,
one option is a list; another is a histogram (dictionary).
\index{implementation}

How should you choose?  The first step is to think about
the operations you will need to implement for each data structure.
For the prefixes, we need to be able to remove words from
the beginning and add to the end.  For example, if the current
prefix is ``Half a,'' and the next word is ``bee,'' you need
to be able to form the next prefix, ``a bee.''
\index{tuple!as key in dictionary}

Your first choice might be a list, since it is easy to add
and remove elements, but we also need to be able to use the
prefixes as keys in a dictionary, so that rules out lists.
With tuples, you can't append or remove, but you can use
the addition operator to form a new tuple:

\begin{verbatim}
def shift(prefix, word):
    return prefix[1:] + (word,)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt shift} takes a tuple of words, {\tt prefix}, and a string, 
{\tt word}, and forms a new tuple that has all the words
in {\tt prefix} except the first, and {\tt word} added to
the end.

For the collection of suffixes, the operations we need to
perform include adding a new suffix (or increasing the frequency
of an existing one), and choosing a random suffix.

Adding a new suffix is equally easy for the list implementation
or the histogram.  Choosing a random element from a list
is easy; choosing from a histogram is harder to do
efficiently (see Exercise~\ref{randhist}).

So far we have been talking mostly about ease of implementation,
but there are other factors to consider in choosing data structures.
One is run time.  Sometimes there is a theoretical reason to expect
one data structure to be faster than other; for example, I mentioned
that the {\tt in} operator is faster for dictionaries than for lists,
at least when the number of elements is large.

But often you don't know ahead of time which implementation will
be faster.  One option is to implement both of them and see which
is better.  This approach is called {\bf benchmarking}.  A practical
alternative is to choose the data structure that is
easiest to implement, and then see if it is fast enough for the
intended application.  If so, there is no need to go on.  If not,
there are tools, like the {\tt profile} module, that can identify
the places in a program that take the most time.
\index{benchmarking}
\index{profile module}
\index{module!profile}

The other factor to consider is storage space.  For example, using a
histogram for the collection of suffixes might take less space because
you only have to store each word once, no matter how many times it
appears in the text.  In some cases, saving space can also make your
program run faster, and in the extreme, your program might not run at
all if you run out of memory.  But for many applications, space is a
secondary consideration after run time.

One final thought: in this discussion, I have implied that
we should use one data structure for both analysis and generation.  But
since these are separate phases, it would also be possible to use one
structure for analysis and then convert to another structure for
generation.  This would be a net win if the time saved during
generation exceeded the time spent in conversion.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are
working on a hard bug, there are four things to try:

\begin{description}

\item[reading:] Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and
check that it says what you meant to say.

\item[running:] Experiment by making changes and running different
versions.  Often if you display the right thing at the right place
in the program, the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to
spend some time to build scaffolding.

\item[ruminating:] Take some time to think!  What kind of error
is it: syntax, runtime, semantic?  What information can you get from
the error messages, or from the output of the program?  What kind of
error could cause the problem you're seeing?  What did you change
last, before the problem appeared?

\item[retreating:] At some point, the best thing to do is back
off, undoing recent changes, until you get back to a program that
works and that you understand.  Then you can start rebuilding.

\end{description}

Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities
and forget the others.  Each activity comes with its own failure
mode.
\index{typographical error}

For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a
typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual
misunderstanding.  If you don't understand what your program does, you
can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in
your head.
\index{experimental debugging}

Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple
tests.  But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your
code, you might fall into a pattern I call ``random walk programming,''
which is the process of making random changes until the program
does the right thing.  Needless to say, random walk programming
can take a long time.
\index{random walk programming}
\index{development plan!random walk programming}

You have to take time to think.  Debugging is like an
experimental science.  You should have at least one hypothesis about
what the problem is.  If there are two or more possibilities, try to
think of a test that would eliminate one of them.

Taking a break helps with the thinking.  So does talking.
If you explain the problem to someone else (or even yourself), you
will sometimes find the answer before you finish asking the question.

But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many
errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and
complicated.  Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the
program until you get to something that works and that you
understand.

Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because
they can't stand to delete a line of code (even if it's wrong).
If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another file
before you start stripping it down.  Then you can paste the pieces
back in a little bit at a time.

Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and
sometimes retreating.  If you get stuck on one of these activities,
try the others.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
\index{word frequency}
\index{frequency!word}
\index{Zipf's law}

The ``rank'' of a word is its position in a list of words
sorted by frequency: the most common word has rank 1, the
second most common has rank 2, etc.

Zipf's law describes a relationship between the ranks and frequencies
of words in natural languages
(\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law}).  Specifically, it
predicts that the frequency, $f$, of the word with rank $r$ is:

\[ f = c r^{-s} \]
%
where $s$ and $c$ are parameters that depend on the language and the
text.  If you take the logarithm of both sides of this equation, you
get:
\index{logarithm}

\[ \log f = \log c - s \log r \]
%
So if you plot log $f$ versus log $r$, you should get
a straight line with slope $-s$ and intercept log $c$.

Write a program that reads a text from a file, counts
word frequencies, and prints one line
for each word, in descending order of frequency, with
log $f$ and log $r$.  Use the graphing program of your
choice to plot the results and check whether they form
a straight line.  Can you estimate the value of $s$?

Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/zipf.py}.  To make the plots, you
might have to install matplotlib (see
\url{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/}).
\index{Matplotlib}

\end{exercise}


\chapter{Files}


\section{Persistence}
\index{file}
\index{type!file}
\index{persistence}

Most of the programs we have seen so far are transient in the
sense that they run for a short time and produce some output,
but when they end, their data disappears.  If you run the program
again, it starts with a clean slate.

Other programs are {\bf persistent}: they run for a long time
(or all the time); they keep at least some of their data
in permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and
if they shut down and restart, they pick up where they left off.

Examples of persistent programs are operating systems, which
run pretty much whenever a computer is on, and web servers,
which run all the time, waiting for requests to come in on
the network.

One of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data
is by reading and writing text files.  We have already seen
programs that read text files; in this chapter we will see programs
that write them.

An alternative is to store the state of the program in a database.
In this chapter I will present a simple database and a module,
{\tt pickle}, that makes it easy to store program data.
\index{pickle module}
\index{module!pickle}


\section{Reading and writing}
\index{file!reading and writing}

A text file is a sequence of characters stored on a permanent
medium like a hard drive, flash memory, or CD-ROM.  We saw how
to open and read a file in Section~\ref{wordlist}.
\index{open function}
\index{function!open}

To write a file, you have to open it with mode \verb"'w'" as a second
parameter:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fout = open('output.txt', 'w')
>>> print fout
<open file 'output.txt', mode 'w' at 0xb7eb2410>
\end{verbatim}
%
If the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out
the old data and starts fresh, so be careful!
If the file doesn't exist, a new one is created.

The {\tt write} method puts data into the file.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> line1 = "This here's the wattle,\n"
>>> fout.write(line1)
\end{verbatim}
%
Again, the file object keeps track of where it is, so if
you call {\tt write} again, it adds the new data to the end.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> line2 = "the emblem of our land.\n"
>>> fout.write(line2)
\end{verbatim}
%
When you are done writing, you have to close the file.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fout.close()
\end{verbatim}
%
\index{close method}
\index{method!close}


\section{Format operator}
\index{format operator}
\index{operator!format}

The argument of {\tt write} has to be a string, so if we want
to put other values in a file, we have to convert them to
strings.  The easiest way to do that is with {\tt str}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> x = 52
>>> f.write(str(x))
\end{verbatim}
%
An alternative is to use the {\bf format operator}, {\tt \%}.  When
applied to integers, {\tt \%} is the modulus operator.  But
when the first operand is a string, {\tt \%} is the format operator.
\index{format string}

The first operand is the {\bf format string}, which contains
one or more {\bf format sequences}, which
specify how
the second operand is formatted.  The result is a string.
\index{format sequence}

For example, the format sequence \verb"'%d'" means that
the second operand should be formatted as an
integer ({\tt d} stands for ``decimal''):

\begin{verbatim}
>>> camels = 42
>>> '%d' % camels
'42'
\end{verbatim}
%
The result is the string \verb"'42'", which is not to be confused
with the integer value {\tt 42}.

A format sequence can appear anywhere in the string,
so you can embed a value in a sentence:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> camels = 42
>>> 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels
'I have spotted 42 camels.'
\end{verbatim}
%
If there is more than one format sequence in the string,
the second argument has to be a tuple.  Each format sequence is
matched with an element of the tuple, in order.

The following example uses \verb"'%d'" to format an integer,
\verb"'%g'" to format
a floating-point number (don't ask why), and \verb"'%s'" to format
a string:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels')
'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.'
\end{verbatim}
%
The number of elements in the tuple has to match the number
of format sequences in the string.  Also, the types of the
elements have to match the format sequences:
\index{exception!TypeError}
\index{TypeError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> '%d %d %d' % (1, 2)
TypeError: not enough arguments for format string
>>> '%d' % 'dollars'
TypeError: illegal argument type for built-in operation
\end{verbatim}
%
In the first example, there aren't enough elements; in the
second, the element is the wrong type.

The format operator is powerful, but it can be difficult to use.  You
can read more about it at
\url{docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-strings.html}.

% You can specify the number of digits as part of the format sequence.
% For example, the sequence \verb"'%8.2f'"
% formats a floating-point number to be 8 characters long, with
% 2 digits after the decimal point:

% % \begin{verbatim}
% >>> '%8.2f' % 3.14159
% '    3.14'
% \end{verbatim}
% \afterverb
% %
% The result takes up eight spaces with two
% digits after the decimal point.  


\section{Filenames and paths}
\label{paths}
\index{filename}
\index{path}
\index{directory}
\index{folder}

Files are organized into {\bf directories} (also called ``folders'').
Every running program has a ``current directory,'' which is the
default directory for most operations.  
For example, when you open a file for reading, Python looks for it in the
current directory.
\index{os module}
\index{module!os}

The {\tt os} module provides functions for working with files and
directories (``os'' stands for ``operating system'').  {\tt os.getcwd}
returns the name of the current directory:
\index{getcwd function}
\index{function!getcwd}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import os
>>> cwd = os.getcwd()
>>> print cwd
/home/dinsdale
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt cwd} stands for ``current working directory.''  The result in
this example is {\tt /home/dinsdale}, which is the home directory of a
user named {\tt dinsdale}.
\index{working directory}
\index{directory!working}

A string like {\tt cwd} that identifies a file is called a {\bf path}.
A {\bf relative path} starts from the current directory;
an {\bf absolute path} starts from the topmost directory in the
file system.
\index{relative path}
\index{path!relative}
\index{absolute path}
\index{path!absolute}

The paths we have seen so far are simple filenames, so they are
relative to the current directory.  To find the absolute path to
a file, you can use {\tt os.path.abspath}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> os.path.abspath('memo.txt')
'/home/dinsdale/memo.txt'
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt os.path.exists} checks
whether a file or directory exists:
\index{exists function}
\index{function!exists}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> os.path.exists('memo.txt')
True
\end{verbatim}
%
If it exists, {\tt os.path.isdir} checks whether it's a directory:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> os.path.isdir('memo.txt')
False
>>> os.path.isdir('music')
True
\end{verbatim}
%
Similarly, {\tt os.path.isfile} checks whether it's a file.

{\tt os.listdir} returns a list of the files (and other directories)
in the given directory:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> os.listdir(cwd)
['music', 'photos', 'memo.txt']
\end{verbatim}
%
To demonstrate these functions, the following example
``walks'' through a directory, prints
the names of all the files, and calls itself recursively on
all the directories.
\index{walk, directory}
\index{directory!walk}

\begin{verbatim}
def walk(dirname):
    for name in os.listdir(dirname):
        path = os.path.join(dirname, name)

        if os.path.isfile(path):
            print path
        else:
            walk(path)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt os.path.join} takes a directory and a file name and joins
them into a complete path.  

\begin{exercise}

The {\tt os} module provides a function called {\tt walk}
that is similar to this one but more versatile.  Read
the documentation and use it to print the names of the
files in a given directory and its subdirectories.

Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/walk.py}.

\end{exercise}


\section{Catching exceptions}
\label{catch}

A lot of things can go wrong when you try to read and write
files.  If you try to open a file that doesn't exist, you get an
{\tt IOError}:
\index{open function}
\index{function!open}
\index{exception!IOError}
\index{IOError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fin = open('bad_file')
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'bad_file'
\end{verbatim}
%
If you don't have permission to access a file:
\index{file!permission}
\index{permission, file}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fout = open('/etc/passwd', 'w')
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/passwd'
\end{verbatim}
%
And if you try to open a directory for reading, you get

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fin = open('/home')
IOError: [Errno 21] Is a directory
\end{verbatim}
%
To avoid these errors, you could use functions like {\tt os.path.exists}
and {\tt os.path.isfile}, but it would take a lot of time and code
to check all the possibilities (if ``{\tt Errno 21}'' is any
indication, there are at least 21 things that can go wrong).
\index{exception, catching}
\index{try statement}
\index{statement!try}

It is better to go ahead and try---and deal with problems if they
happen---which is exactly what the {\tt try} statement does.  The
syntax is similar to an {\tt if} statement:

\begin{verbatim}
try:    
    fin = open('bad_file')
    for line in fin:
        print line
    fin.close()
except:
    print 'Something went wrong.'
\end{verbatim}
%
Python starts by executing the {\tt try} clause.  If all goes
well, it skips the {\tt except} clause and proceeds.  If an
exception occurs, it jumps out of the {\tt try} clause and
executes the {\tt except} clause.

Handling an exception with a {\tt try} statement is called {\bf
catching} an exception.  In this example, the {\tt except} clause
prints an error message that is not very helpful.  In general,
catching an exception gives you a chance to fix the problem, or try
again, or at least end the program gracefully.

\begin{exercise}

Write a function called {\tt sed} that takes as arguments a pattern string,
a replacement string, and two filenames; it should read the first file
and write the contents into the second file (creating it if
necessary).  If the pattern string appears anywhere in the file, it
should be replaced with the replacement string.

If an error occurs while opening, reading, writing or closing files,
your program should catch the exception, print an error message, and
exit.  Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/sed.py}.

\end{exercise}


\section{Databases}
\index{database}

A {\bf database} is a file that is organized for storing data.
Most databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense
that they map from keys to values.  The biggest difference
is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage),
so it persists after the program ends.
\index{anydbm module}
\index{module!anydbm}

The module {\tt anydbm} provides an interface for creating
and updating database files.  As an example, I'll create a database
that contains captions for image files.
\index{open function}
\index{function!open}

Opening a database is similar to opening other files:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import anydbm
>>> db = anydbm.open('captions.db', 'c')
\end{verbatim}
%
The mode \verb"'c'" means that the database should be created if
it doesn't already exist.  The result is a database object
that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary.
If you create a new item, {\tt anydbm} updates the database file.
\index{update!database}


\begin{verbatim}
>>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese.'
\end{verbatim}
%
When you access one of the items, {\tt anydbm} reads the file:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print db['cleese.png']
Photo of John Cleese.
\end{verbatim}
%
If you make another assignment to an existing key, {\tt anydbm} replaces
the old value:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.'
>>> print db['cleese.png']
Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.
\end{verbatim}
%
Many dictionary methods, like {\tt keys} and {\tt items}, also
work with database objects.  So does iteration with a {\tt for}
statement.
\index{dictionary methods!anydbm module}

\begin{verbatim}
for key in db:
    print key
\end{verbatim}
%
As with other files, you should close the database when you are
done:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> db.close()
\end{verbatim}
%
\index{close method}
\index{method!close}


\section{Pickling}
\index{pickling}

A limitation of {\tt anydbm} is that the keys and values have
to be strings.  If you try to use any other type, you get an
error.
\index{pickle module}
\index{module!pickle}

The {\tt pickle} module can help.  It translates
almost any type of object into a string suitable for storage in a
database, and then translates strings back into objects.

{\tt pickle.dumps} takes an object as a parameter and returns
a string representation ({\tt dumps} is short for ``dump string''):

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import pickle
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> pickle.dumps(t)
'(lp0\nI1\naI2\naI3\na.'
\end{verbatim}
%
The format isn't obvious to human readers; it is meant to be
easy for {\tt pickle} to interpret.  {\tt pickle.loads}
(``load string'') reconstitutes the object:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t1 = [1, 2, 3]
>>> s = pickle.dumps(t1)
>>> t2 = pickle.loads(s)
>>> print t2
[1, 2, 3]
\end{verbatim}
%
Although the new object has the same value as the old, it is
not (in general) the same object:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t1 == t2
True
>>> t1 is t2
False
\end{verbatim}
%
In other words, pickling and then unpickling has the same effect
as copying the object.

You can use {\tt pickle} to store non-strings in a database.
In fact, this combination is so common that it has been
encapsulated in a module called {\tt shelve}.  
\index{shelve module}
\index{module!shelve}


\begin{exercise}
\index{anagram set}
\index{set!anagram}

If you download my solution to Exercise~\ref{anagrams} from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/anagram_sets.py}, you'll see that it creates
a dictionary that maps from a sorted string of letters to the list of
words that can be spelled with those letters.  For example, {\tt
  'opst'} maps to the list {\tt ['opts', 'post', 'pots', 'spot',
    'stop', 'tops']}.

Write a module that imports \verb"anagram_sets" and provides
two new functions: \verb"store_anagrams" should store the
anagram dictionary in a ``shelf;'' \verb"read_anagrams" should
look up a word and return a list of its anagrams.
Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/anagram_db.py}

\end{exercise}


\section{Pipes}
\index{shell}
\index{pipe}

Most operating systems provide a command-line interface,
also known as a {\bf shell}.  Shells usually provide commands
to navigate the file system and launch applications.  For
example, in Unix you can change directories with {\tt cd},
display the contents of a directory with {\tt ls}, and launch
a web browser by typing (for example) {\tt firefox}.
\index{ls (Unix command)}
\index{Unix command!ls}

Any program that you can launch from the shell can also be
launched from Python using a {\bf pipe}.  A pipe is an object
that represents a running program.

For example, the Unix command {\tt ls -l} normally displays the
contents of the current directory (in long format).  You can
launch {\tt ls} with {\tt os.popen}\footnote{{\tt popen} is deprecated
now, which means we are supposed to stop using it and start using
the {\tt subprocess} module.  But for simple cases, I find
{\tt subprocess} more complicated than necessary.  So I am going
to keep using {\tt popen} until they take it away.}:
\index{popen function}
\index{function!popen}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> cmd = 'ls -l'
>>> fp = os.popen(cmd)
\end{verbatim}
%
The argument is a string that contains a shell command.  The
return value is an object that behaves just like an open
file.  You can read the output from the {\tt ls} process one
line at a time with {\tt readline} or get the whole thing at
once with {\tt read}:
\index{readline method}
\index{method!readline}
\index{read method}
\index{method!read}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> res = fp.read()
\end{verbatim}
%
When you are done, you close the pipe like a file:
\index{close method}
\index{method!close}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> stat = fp.close()
>>> print stat
None
\end{verbatim}
%
The return value is the final status of the {\tt ls} process;
{\tt None} means that it ended normally (with no errors).

For example, most Unix systems provide a command called {\tt md5sum}
that reads the contents of a file and computes a ``checksum.''
You can read about MD5 at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5}.  This
command provides an efficient way to check whether two files
have the same contents.  The probability that different contents
yield the same checksum is very small (that is, unlikely to happen
before the universe collapses).
\index{md5}
\index{checksum}

You can use a pipe to run {\tt md5sum} from Python and get the result:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> filename = 'book.tex'
>>> cmd = 'md5sum ' + filename
>>> fp = os.popen(cmd)
>>> res = fp.read()
>>> stat = fp.close()
>>> print res
1e0033f0ed0656636de0d75144ba32e0  book.tex
>>> print stat
None
\end{verbatim}


\begin{exercise}
\label{checksum}
\index{MP3}

In a large collection of MP3 files, there may be more than one
copy of the same song, stored in different directories or with
different file names.  The goal of this exercise is to search for
duplicates.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a program that searches a directory and all of its
subdirectories, recursively, and returns a list of complete paths
for all files with a given suffix (like {\tt .mp3}).
Hint: {\tt os.path} provides several useful functions for
manipulating file and path names.
\index{duplicate}
\index{MD5 algorithm}
\index{algorithm!MD5}
\index{checksum}

\item To recognize duplicates, you can use {\tt md5sum}
to compute a ``checksum'' for each files.  If two files have
the same checksum, they probably have the same contents.
\index{md5sum}

\item To double-check, you can use the Unix command {\tt diff}.
\index{diff}

\end{enumerate}

Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/find_duplicates.py}.

\end{exercise}


\section{Writing modules}
\label{modules}
\index{module, writing}
\index{word count}

Any file that contains Python code can be imported as a module.
For example, suppose you have a file named {\tt wc.py} with the following
code:

\begin{verbatim}
def linecount(filename):
    count = 0
    for line in open(filename):
        count += 1
    return count

print linecount('wc.py')
\end{verbatim}
%
If you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number
of lines in the file, which is 7.
You can also import it like this:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import wc
7
\end{verbatim}
%
Now you have a module object {\tt wc}:
\index{module object}
\index{object!module}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print wc
<module 'wc' from 'wc.py'>
\end{verbatim}
%
That provides a function called \verb"linecount":

\begin{verbatim}
>>> wc.linecount('wc.py')
7
\end{verbatim}
%
So that's how you write modules in Python.

The only problem with this example is that when you import
the module it executes the test code at the bottom.  Normally
when you import a module, it defines new functions but it
doesn't execute them.
\index{import statement}
\index{statement!import}

Programs that will be imported as modules often
use the following idiom:

\begin{verbatim}
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print linecount('wc.py')
\end{verbatim}
%
\verb"__name__" is a built-in variable that is set when the
program starts.  If the program is running as a script,
\verb"__name__" has the value \verb"__main__"; in that
case, the test code is executed.  Otherwise,
if the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.

\begin{exercise}

Type this example into a file named {\tt wc.py} and run
it as a script.  Then run the Python interpreter and
{\tt import wc}.  What is the value of \verb"__name__"
when the module is being imported?

Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported,
Python does nothing.  It does not re-read the file, even if it has
changed.
\index{module!reload}
\index{reload function}
\index{function!reload}

If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function 
{\tt reload}, but it can be tricky, so the safest thing to do is
restart the interpreter and then import the module again.

\end{exercise}



\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}
\index{whitespace}

When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems
with whitespace.  These errors can be hard to debug because spaces,
tabs and newlines are normally invisible:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> s = '1 2\t 3\n 4'
>>> print s
1 2	 3
 4
\end{verbatim}
\index{repr function}
\index{function!repr}
\index{string representation}

The built-in function {\tt repr} can help.  It takes any object as an
argument and returns a string representation of the object.  For
strings, it represents whitespace
characters with backslash sequences:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print repr(s)
'1 2\t 3\n 4'
\end{verbatim}

This can be helpful for debugging.

One other problem you might run into is that different systems
use different characters to indicate the end of a line.  Some
systems use a newline, represented \verb"\n".  Others use
a return character, represented \verb"\r".  Some use both.
If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies
might cause problems.
\index{end of line character}

For most systems, there are applications to convert from one
format to another.  You can find them (and read more about this
issue) at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline}.  Or, of course, you
could write one yourself.

%\index{Internet Movie Database (IMDb)}
%\index{IMDb (Internet Movie Database)}
%\index{database}

%The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an online collection of
%information about movies.  Their database is available
%in plain text format, so it is reasonably easy to read from
%Python.  For this exercise, the files you need
%are {\tt actors.list.gz} and {\tt actresses.list.gz}; you

%If you run {\tt imdb.py} as a script, it reads {\tt actors.list.gz}
%and prints one actor-movie pair per line.  Or, if you {\tt import
%imdb} you can use the function \verb"process_file" to, well,
%process the file.  The arguments are a filename, a function

%    print actor, date, title, role

%imdb.process_file('actors.list.gz', print_info)
%\end{verbatim}

%When you call \verb"process_file", it opens {\tt filename}, reads the

\chapter{Classes and objects}

Code examples from this chapter are available from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/Point1.py}; solutions
to the exercises are available from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/Point1_soln.py}.


\section{User-defined types}
\label{point}
\index{user-defined type}
\index{type!user-defined}

We have used many of Python's built-in types; now we are going
to define a new type.  As an example, we will create a type
called {\tt Point} that represents a point in two-dimensional
space.
\index{point, mathematical}

In mathematical notation, points are often written in
parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example,
$(0,0)$ represents the origin, and $(x,y)$ represents the
point $x$ units to the right and $y$ units up from the origin.

There are several ways we might represent points in Python:

\begin{itemize}

\item We could store the coordinates separately in two
variables, {\tt x} and {\tt y}.

\item We could store the coordinates as elements in a list
or tuple.

\item We could create a new type to represent points as
objects.

\end{itemize}
\index{representation}

Creating a new type
is (a little) more complicated than the other options, but
it has advantages that will be apparent soon.

A user-defined type is also called a {\bf class}.
A class definition looks like this:
\index{class}
\index{object}
\index{class definition}
\index{definition!class}

\begin{verbatim}
class Point(object):
    """Represents a point in 2-D space."""
\end{verbatim}
%
This header indicates that the new class is a {\tt Point},
which is a kind of {\tt object}, which is a built-in
type.
\index{Point class}
\index{class!Point}

The body is a docstring that explains what the class is for.
You can define variables and functions inside a class definition,
but we will get back to that later.
\index{docstring}

Defining a class named {\tt Point} creates a class object.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print Point
<class '__main__.Point'>
\end{verbatim}
%
Because {\tt Point} is defined at the top level, its ``full
name'' is \verb"__main__.Point".
\index{object!class}
\index{class object}

The class object is like a factory for creating objects.  To create a
Point, you call {\tt Point} as if it were a function.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> blank = Point()
>>> print blank
<__main__.Point instance at 0xb7e9d3ac>
\end{verbatim}
%
The return value is a reference to a Point object, which we
assign to {\tt blank}.  
Creating a new object is called
{\bf instantiation}, and the object is an {\bf instance} of
the class.
\index{instance}
\index{instantiation}

When you print an instance, Python tells you what class it
belongs to and where it is stored in memory (the prefix
{\tt 0x} means that the following number is in hexadecimal).
\index{hexadecimal}


\section{Attributes}
\label{attributes}
\index{instance attribute}
\index{attribute!instance}
\index{dot notation}

You can assign values to an instance using dot notation:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> blank.x = 3.0
>>> blank.y = 4.0
\end{verbatim}
%
This syntax is similar to the syntax for selecting a variable from a
module, such as {\tt math.pi} or {\tt string.whitespace}.  In this case,
though, we are assigning values to named elements of an object.
These elements are called {\bf attributes}.

As a noun, ``AT-trib-ute'' is pronounced with emphasis on the first
syllable, as opposed to ``a-TRIB-ute,'' which is a verb.

The following diagram shows the result of these assignments.
A state diagram that shows an object and its attributes is
called an {\bf object diagram}; see Figure~\ref{fig.point}.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}
\index{object diagram}
\index{diagram!object}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/point.pdf}}
\caption{Object diagram.}
\label{fig.point}
\end{figure}


The variable {\tt blank} refers to a Point object, which
contains two attributes.  Each attribute refers to a
floating-point number.

You can read the value of an attribute using the same syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print blank.y
4.0
>>> x = blank.x
>>> print x
3.0
\end{verbatim}
%
The expression {\tt blank.x} means, ``Go to the object {\tt blank}
refers to and get the value of {\tt x}.'' In this case, we assign that
value to a variable named {\tt x}.  There is no conflict between
the variable {\tt x} and the attribute {\tt x}.

You can use dot notation as part of any expression.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print '(%g, %g)' % (blank.x, blank.y)
(3.0, 4.0)
>>> distance = math.sqrt(blank.x**2 + blank.y**2)
>>> print distance
5.0
\end{verbatim}
%
You can pass an instance as an argument in the usual way.
For example:
\index{instance!as argument}

\begin{verbatim}
def print_point(p):
    print '(%g, %g)' % (p.x, p.y)
\end{verbatim}
%
\verb"print_point" takes a point as an argument and displays it in
mathematical notation.  To invoke it, you can pass {\tt blank} as
an argument:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print_point(blank)
(3.0, 4.0)
\end{verbatim}
%
Inside the function, {\tt p} is an alias for {\tt blank}, so if
the function modifies {\tt p}, {\tt blank} changes.
\index{aliasing}


\begin{exercise}

Write a function called \verb"distance_between_points" that takes two
Points as arguments and returns the distance between them.

\end{exercise}



\section{Rectangles}
\label{rectangles}

Sometimes it is obvious what the attributes of an object should be,
but other times you have to make decisions.  For example, imagine you
are designing a class to represent rectangles.  What attributes would
you use to specify the location and size of a rectangle?  You can
ignore angle; to keep things simple, assume that the rectangle is
either vertical or horizontal.
\index{representation}

There are at least two possibilities: 

\begin{itemize}

\item You could specify one corner of the rectangle
(or the center), the width, and the height.

\item You could specify two opposing corners.

\end{itemize}

At this point it is hard to say whether either is better than
the other, so we'll implement the first one, just as an example.
\index{Rectangle class}
\index{class!Rectangle}

Here is the class definition:

\begin{verbatim}
class Rectangle(object):
    """Represents a rectangle. 

    attributes: width, height, corner.
    """
\end{verbatim}
%
The docstring lists the attributes:  {\tt width} and
{\tt height} are numbers; {\tt corner} is a Point object that
specifies the lower-left corner.

To represent a rectangle, you have to instantiate a Rectangle
object and assign values to the attributes:

\begin{verbatim}
box = Rectangle()
box.width = 100.0
box.height = 200.0
box.corner = Point()
box.corner.x = 0.0
box.corner.y = 0.0
\end{verbatim}
%
The expression {\tt box.corner.x} means,
``Go to the object {\tt box} refers to and select the attribute named
{\tt corner}; then go to that object and select the attribute named
{\tt x}.''

\section{Instances as return values}
\index{instance!as return value}
\index{return value}

Functions can return instances.  For example, \verb"find_center"
takes a {\tt Rectangle} as an argument and returns a {\tt Point}
that contains the coordinates of the center of the {\tt Rectangle}:

\begin{verbatim}
def find_center(rect):
    p = Point()
    p.x = rect.corner.x + rect.width/2.0
    p.y = rect.corner.y + rect.height/2.0
    return p
\end{verbatim}
%
Here is an example that passes {\tt box} as an argument and assigns
the resulting Point to {\tt center}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> center = find_center(box)
>>> print_point(center)
(50.0, 100.0)
\end{verbatim}
%

\section{Objects are mutable}
\index{object!mutable}
\index{mutability}

You can change the state of an object by making an assignment to one of
its attributes.  For example, to change the size of a rectangle
without changing its position, you can modify the values of {\tt
width} and {\tt height}:

\begin{verbatim}
box.width = box.width + 50
box.height = box.width + 100
\end{verbatim}
%
You can also write functions that modify objects.  For example,
\verb"grow_rectangle" takes a Rectangle object and two numbers,
{\tt dwidth} and {\tt dheight}, and adds the numbers to the
width and height of the rectangle:

\begin{verbatim}
def grow_rectangle(rect, dwidth, dheight):
    rect.width += dwidth
    rect.height += dheight
\end{verbatim}
%
Here is an example that demonstrates the effect:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print box.width
100.0
>>> print box.height
200.0
>>> grow_rectangle(box, 50, 100)
>>> print box.width
150.0
>>> print box.height
300.0
\end{verbatim}
%
Inside the function, {\tt rect} is an
alias for {\tt box}, so if the function modifies {\tt rect}, 
{\tt box} changes.

\begin{exercise}

Write a function named \verb"move_rectangle" that takes
a Rectangle and two numbers named {\tt dx} and {\tt dy}.  It
should change the location of the rectangle by adding {\tt dx}
to the {\tt x} coordinate of {\tt corner} and adding {\tt dy}
to the {\tt y} coordinate of {\tt corner}.

\end{exercise}


\section{Copying}
\label{copying}
\index{aliasing}

Aliasing can make a program difficult to read because changes
in one place might have unexpected effects in another place.
It is hard to keep track of all the variables that might refer
to a given object.
\index{copying objects}
\index{object!copying}
\index{copy module}
\index{module!copy}

Copying an object is often an alternative to aliasing.
The {\tt copy} module contains a function called {\tt copy} that
can duplicate any object:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> p1 = Point()
>>> p1.x = 3.0
>>> p1.y = 4.0

>>> import copy
>>> p2 = copy.copy(p1)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt p1} and {\tt p2} contain the same data, but they are
not the same Point.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print_point(p1)
(3.0, 4.0)
>>> print_point(p2)
(3.0, 4.0)
>>> p1 is p2
False
>>> p1 == p2
False
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt is} operator indicates that {\tt p1} and {\tt p2} are not the
same object, which is what we expected.  But you might have expected
{\tt ==} to yield {\tt True} because these points contain the same
data.  In that case, you will be disappointed to learn that for
instances, the default behavior of the {\tt ==} operator is the same
as the {\tt is} operator; it checks object identity, not object
equivalence.  This behavior can be changed---we'll see how later.
\index{is operator}
\index{operator!is}

If you use {\tt copy.copy} to duplicate a Rectangle, you will find
that it copies the Rectangle object but not the embedded Point.
\index{embedded object!copying}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> box2 = copy.copy(box)
>>> box2 is box
False
>>> box2.corner is box.corner
True
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/rectangle2.pdf}}
\caption{Object diagram.}
\label{fig.rectangle2}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig.rectangle2} shows what the object diagram looks like.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}
\index{object diagram}
\index{diagram!object}
This operation is called a {\bf shallow copy} because it copies the
object and any references it contains, but not the embedded objects.
\index{shallow copy}
\index{copy!shallow}

For most applications, this is not what you want.  In this example,
invoking \verb"grow_rectangle" on one of the Rectangles would not
affect the other, but invoking \verb"move_rectangle" on either would
affect both!  This behavior is confusing and error-prone.
\index{deep copy}
\index{copy!deep}

Fortunately, the {\tt copy} module contains a method named {\tt
deepcopy} that copies not only the object but also 
the objects it refers to, and the objects {\em they} refer to,
and so on.
You will not be surprised to learn that this operation is
called a {\bf deep copy}.
\index{deepcopy function}
\index{function!deepcopy}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> box3 = copy.deepcopy(box)
>>> box3 is box
False
>>> box3.corner is box.corner
False
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt box3} and {\tt box} are completely separate objects.


\begin{exercise}

Write a version of \verb"move_rectangle" that creates and
returns a new Rectangle instead of modifying the old one.

\end{exercise}


\section{Debugging}
\label{hasattr}
\index{debugging}

When you start working with objects, you are likely to encounter
some new exceptions.  If you try to access an attribute
that doesn't exist, you get an {\tt AttributeError}:
\index{exception!AttributeError}
\index{AttributeError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> p = Point()
>>> print p.z
AttributeError: Point instance has no attribute 'z'
\end{verbatim}
%
If you are not sure what type an object is, you can ask:
\index{type function}
\index{function!type}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(p)
<type '__main__.Point'>
\end{verbatim}
%
If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute,
you can use the built-in function {\tt hasattr}:
\index{hasattr function}
\index{function!hasattr}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> hasattr(p, 'x')
True
>>> hasattr(p, 'z')
False
\end{verbatim}
%
The first argument can be any object; the second argument is a {\em
string} that contains the name of the attribute.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
\label{canvas}
\index{Swampy}
\index{World module}
\index{module!World}

Swampy (see Chapter~\ref{turtlechap}) provides a module named {\tt
  World}, which defines a user-defined type also called {\tt World}.
You can import it like this:

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.World import World
\end{verbatim}

The following code creates a World object and calls
the {\tt mainloop} method, which
waits for the user.

\begin{verbatim}
world = World()
world.mainloop()
\end{verbatim}

A window should appear with a title bar and an empty square.
We will use this window to draw Points,
Rectangles and other shapes.  
Add the following lines before calling
\verb"mainloop" and run the program again.
\index{Canvas object}
\index{object!Canvas}

\begin{verbatim}
canvas = world.ca(width=500, height=500, background='white')
bbox = [[-150,-100], [150, 100]]
canvas.rectangle(bbox, outline='black', width=2, fill='green4')
\end{verbatim}

You should see a green rectangle with a black outline.
The first line creates a Canvas, which appears in the window
as a white square.  The Canvas object provides methods like
{\tt rectangle} for drawing various shapes.
\index{bounding box}

{\tt bbox} is a list of lists that represents the ``bounding box''
of the rectangle.  The first pair of coordinates is the lower-left
corner of the rectangle; the second pair is the upper-right corner.

You can draw a circle like this:

\begin{verbatim}
canvas.circle([-25,0], 70, outline=None, fill='red')
\end{verbatim}

The first parameter is the coordinate pair for the center of the
circle; the second parameter is the radius.

If you add this line to the program, 
the result should resemble the national flag of Bangladesh
(see \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_sovereign-state_flags}).
\index{Bangladesh, national flag}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Write a function called \verb"draw_rectangle" that takes a
  Canvas and a Rectangle as arguments and draws a
  representation of the Rectangle on the Canvas.

\item Add an attribute named {\tt color} to your Rectangle objects and

  the fill color.

\item Write a function called \verb"draw_point" that takes a
  Canvas and a Point as arguments and draws a
  representation of the Point on the Canvas.

canvas.polygon(points, fill='blue')
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{Classes and functions}
\label{time}

Code examples from this chapter are available from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/Time1.py}.

\section{Time}
\label{time.object}

As another example of a user-defined type, we'll define a class called
{\tt Time} that records the time of day.  The class definition looks
like this:
\index{user-defined type}
\index{type!user-defined}
\index{Time class}
\index{class!Time}

\begin{verbatim}
class Time(object):
    """Represents the time of day.
       
    attributes: hour, minute, second
    """
\end{verbatim}
%
We can create a new {\tt Time} object and assign
attributes for hours, minutes, and seconds:

\begin{verbatim}
time = Time()
time.hour = 11
time.minute = 59
time.second = 30
\end{verbatim}
%
The state diagram for the {\tt Time} object looks like Figure~\ref{fig.time}.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}
\index{object diagram}
\index{diagram!object}

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex.printtime}

Write a function called \verb"print_time" that takes a 
Time object and prints it in the form {\tt hour:minute:second}.
Hint: the format sequence \verb"'%.2d'" prints an integer using
at least two digits, including a leading zero if necessary.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{isafter}
\index{boolean function}

Write a boolean function called \verb"is_after" that
takes two Time objects, {\tt t1} and {\tt t2}, and
returns {\tt True} if {\tt t1} follows {\tt t2} chronologically and
{\tt False} otherwise.  Challenge: don't use an {\tt if} statement.
\end{exercise}

\begin{figure}

\label{fig.time}
\end{figure}


\section{Pure functions}
\index{prototype and patch}
\index{development plan!prototype and patch}

In the next few sections, we'll write two functions that add time
values.  They demonstrate two kinds of functions: pure functions and
modifiers.  They also demonstrate a development plan I'll call {\bf
  prototype and patch}, which is a way of tackling a complex problem
by starting with a simple prototype and incrementally dealing with the
complications.

Here is a simple prototype of \verb"add_time":

\begin{verbatim}
def add_time(t1, t2):
    sum = Time()
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second
    return sum
\end{verbatim}
%
The function creates a new {\tt Time} object, initializes its
attributes, and returns a reference to the new object.  This is called
a {\bf pure function} because it does not modify any of the objects
passed to it as arguments and it has no effect,
like displaying a value or getting user input, 
other than returning a value.
\index{pure function}
\index{function type!pure}

To test this function, I'll create two Time objects: {\tt start}
contains the start time of a movie, like {\em Monty Python and the
Holy Grail}, and {\tt duration} contains the run time of the movie,
which is one hour 35 minutes.
\index{Monty Python and the Holy Grail}

\verb"add_time" figures out when the movie will be done.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start = Time()
>>> start.hour = 9
>>> start.minute = 45
>>> start.second =  0

>>> duration = Time()
>>> duration.hour = 1
>>> duration.minute = 35
>>> duration.second = 0

>>> done = add_time(start, duration)
>>> print_time(done)
10:80:00
\end{verbatim}
%
The result, {\tt 10:80:00} might not be what you were hoping
for.  The problem is that this function does not deal with cases where the
number of seconds or minutes adds up to more than sixty.  When that
happens, we have to ``carry'' the extra seconds into the minute column
or the extra minutes into the hour column.
\index{carrying, addition with}

Here's an improved version:

\begin{verbatim}
def add_time(t1, t2):
    sum = Time()
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second

    if sum.second >= 60:
        sum.second -= 60
        sum.minute += 1

    if sum.minute >= 60:
        sum.minute -= 60
        sum.hour += 1

    return sum
\end{verbatim}
%
Although this function is correct, it is starting to get big.
We will see a shorter alternative later.


\section{Modifiers}
\label{increment}
\index{modifier}
\index{function type!modifier}

Sometimes it is useful for a function to modify the objects it gets as
parameters.  In that case, the changes are visible to the caller.
Functions that work this way are called {\bf modifiers}.
\index{increment}

{\tt increment}, which adds a given number of seconds to a {\tt Time}
object, can be written naturally as a
modifier.  Here is a rough draft:

\begin{verbatim}
def increment(time, seconds):
    time.second += seconds

    if time.second >= 60:
        time.second -= 60
        time.minute += 1

    if time.minute >= 60:
        time.minute -= 60
        time.hour += 1
\end{verbatim}
%
The first line performs the basic operation; the remainder deals
with the special cases we saw before.
\index{special case}

Is this function correct?  What happens if the parameter {\tt seconds}
is much greater than sixty?  

In that case, it is not enough to carry
once; we have to keep doing it until {\tt time.second} is less than sixty.
One solution is to replace the {\tt if} statements with {\tt while}
statements.  That would make the function correct, but not
very efficient.

\begin{exercise}

Write a correct version of {\tt increment} that
doesn't contain any loops.

\end{exercise}

Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure
functions.  In fact, some programming languages only allow pure
functions.  There is some evidence that programs that use pure
functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs
that use modifiers.  But modifiers are convenient at times,
and functional programs tend to be less efficient.

In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is
reasonable and resort to modifiers only if there is a compelling
advantage.  This approach might be called a {\bf functional
programming style}.
\index{functional programming style}


\begin{exercise}

Write a ``pure'' version of {\tt increment} that creates and returns
a new Time object rather than modifying the parameter.

\end{exercise}


\section{Prototyping versus planning}
\label{prototype}
\index{prototype and patch}
\index{development plan!prototype and patch}
\index{planned development}
\index{development plan!planned}

The development plan I am demonstrating is called ``prototype and
patch.''  For each function, I wrote a prototype that performed the
basic calculation and then tested it, patching errors along the
way.

This approach can be effective, especially if you don't yet have a
deep understanding of the problem.  But incremental corrections can
generate code that is unnecessarily complicated---since it deals with
many special cases---and unreliable---since it is hard to know if you
have found all the errors.

An alternative is {\bf planned development}, in which high-level
insight into the problem can make the programming much easier.  In
this case, the insight is that a Time object is really a three-digit
number in base 60 (see \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal}.)!  The
{\tt second} attribute is the ``ones column,'' the {\tt minute}
attribute is the ``sixties column,'' and the {\tt hour} attribute is
the ``thirty-six hundreds column.''
\index{sexagesimal}

When we wrote \verb"add_time" and {\tt increment}, we were effectively
doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one
column to the next.
\index{carrying, addition with}

This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem---we
can convert Time objects to integers and take advantage of the fact
that the computer knows how to do integer arithmetic.  

Here is a function that converts Times to integers:

\begin{verbatim}
def time_to_int(time):
    minutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute
    seconds = minutes * 60 + time.second
    return seconds
\end{verbatim}
%
And here is the function that converts integers to Times
(recall that {\tt divmod} divides the first argument by the second
and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple).
\index{divmod}

\begin{verbatim}
def int_to_time(seconds):
    time = Time()
    minutes, time.second = divmod(seconds, 60)
    time.hour, time.minute = divmod(minutes, 60)
    return time
\end{verbatim}
%
You might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince
yourself that these functions are correct.  One way to test them is to
check that \verb"time_to_int(int_to_time(x)) == x" for many values of
{\tt x}.  This is an example of a consistency check.
\index{consistency check}

Once you are convinced they are correct, you can use them to 
rewrite \verb"add_time":

\begin{verbatim}
def add_time(t1, t2):
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
This version is shorter than the original, and easier to verify.

\begin{exercise}

Rewrite {\tt increment} using \verb"time_to_int" and \verb"int_to_time".

\end{exercise}

In some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder
than just dealing with times.  Base conversion is more abstract; our
intuition for dealing with time values is better.

But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make
the investment of writing the conversion functions (\verb"time_to_int"
and \verb"int_to_time"), we get a program that is shorter, easier to
read and debug, and more reliable.

It is also easier to add features later.  For example, imagine
subtracting two Times to find the duration between them.  The
naive approach would be to implement subtraction with borrowing.
Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be
correct.
\index{subtraction with borrowing}
\index{borrowing, subtraction with}
\index{generalization}

Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (or more general) makes it
easier (because there are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities
for error).


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

A Time object is well-formed if the values of {\tt minute} and {\tt
second} are between 0 and 60 (including 0 but not 60) and if 
{\tt hour} is positive.  {\tt hour} and {\tt minute} should be
integral values, but we might allow {\tt second} to have a
fraction part.
\index{invariant}

Requirements like these are called {\bf invariants} because
they should always be true.  To put it a different way, if they
are not true, then something has gone wrong.

Writing code to check your invariants can help you detect errors
and find their causes.  For example, you might have a function
like \verb"valid_time" that takes a Time object and returns
{\tt False} if it violates an invariant:

\begin{verbatim}
def valid_time(time):
    if time.hour < 0 or time.minute < 0 or time.second < 0:
        return False
    if time.minute >= 60 or time.second >= 60:
        return False
    return True
\end{verbatim}
%
Then at the beginning of each function you could check the
arguments to make sure they are valid:
\index{raise statement}
\index{statement!raise}

\begin{verbatim}
def add_time(t1, t2):
    if not valid_time(t1) or not valid_time(t2):
        raise ValueError, 'invalid Time object in add_time'
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
Or you could use an {\tt assert} statement, which checks a given invariant
and raises an exception if it fails:
\index{assert statement}
\index{statement!assert}

\begin{verbatim}
def add_time(t1, t2):
    assert valid_time(t1) and valid_time(t2)
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt assert} statements are useful because they distinguish
code that deals with normal conditions from code
that checks for errors.

Code examples from this chapter are available from

\section{Object-oriented features}
\index{object-oriented programming}

Python is an {\bf object-oriented programming language}, which means
that it provides features that support object-oriented
programming.

It is not easy to define object-oriented programming, but we have
already seen some of its characteristics:

\begin{itemize}

\item Programs are made up of object definitions and function
definitions, and most of the computation is expressed in terms
of operations on objects.

\item Each object definition corresponds to some object or concept
in the real world, and the functions that operate on that object
correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.

\end{itemize}

For example, the {\tt Time} class defined in Chapter~\ref{time}
corresponds to the way people record the time of day, and the
functions we defined correspond to the kinds of things people do with
times.  Similarly, the {\tt Point} and {\tt Rectangle} classes
correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.

So far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to
support object-oriented programming.  These
features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide
alternative syntax for things we have already done.  But in many cases,
the alternative is more concise and more accurately conveys the
structure of the program.

For example, in the {\tt Time} program, there is no obvious
connection between the class definition and the function definitions
that follow.  With some examination, it is apparent that every function
takes at least one {\tt Time} object as an argument.
\index{method}
\index{function}

This observation is the motivation for {\bf methods}; a method is
a function that is associated with a particular class.
We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples.
In this chapter, we will define methods for user-defined types.
\index{syntax}
\index{semantics}

Methods are semantically the same as functions, but there are
two syntactic differences:

\begin{itemize}

\item Methods are defined inside a class definition in order
to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit.

\item The syntax for invoking a method is different from the
syntax for calling a function.

\end{itemize}

In the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous
two chapters and transform them into methods.  This transformation is
purely mechanical; you can do it simply by following a sequence of
steps.  If you are comfortable converting from one form to another,
you will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.


\section{Printing objects}
\index{object!printing}

In Chapter~\ref{time}, we defined a class named
{\tt Time} and in Exercise~\ref{ex.printtime}, you 
wrote a function named \verb"print_time":

\begin{verbatim}
class Time(object):
    """Represents the time of day."""

def print_time(time):
    print '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second)
\end{verbatim}
%
To call this function, you have to pass a {\tt Time} object as an
argument:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start = Time()
>>> start.hour = 9
>>> start.minute = 45
>>> start.second = 00
>>> print_time(start)
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
To make \verb"print_time" a method, all we have to do is
move the function definition inside the class definition.  Notice
the change in indentation.
\index{indentation}

\begin{verbatim}
class Time(object):
    def print_time(time):
        print '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second)
\end{verbatim}
%
Now there are two ways to call \verb"print_time".  The first
(and less common) way is to use function syntax:
\index{function syntax}
\index{dot notation}


\begin{verbatim}
>>> Time.print_time(start)
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
In this use of dot notation, {\tt Time} is the name of the class,
and \verb"print_time" is the name of the method.  {\tt start} is
passed as a parameter.

The second (and more concise) way is to use method syntax:
\index{method syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start.print_time()
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
In this use of dot notation, \verb"print_time" is the name of the
method (again), and {\tt start} is the object the method is
invoked on, which is called the {\bf subject}.  Just as the
subject of a sentence is what the sentence is about, the subject
of a method invocation is what the method is about.
\index{subject}

Inside the method, the subject is assigned to the first
parameter, so in this case {\tt start} is assigned
to {\tt time}.
\index{self (parameter name)}
\index{parameter!self}

By convention, the first parameter of a method is
called {\tt self}, so it would be more common to write
\verb"print_time" like this:

\begin{verbatim}
class Time(object):
    def print_time(self):
        print '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second)
\end{verbatim}
%
The reason for this convention is an implicit metaphor:
\index{metaphor, method invocation}

\begin{itemize}

\item The syntax for a function call, \verb"print_time(start)",
  suggests that the function is the active agent.  It says something
  like, ``Hey \verb"print_time"!  Here's an object for you to print.''

\item In object-oriented programming, the objects are the active
  agents.  A method invocation like \verb"start.print_time()" says
  ``Hey {\tt start}!  Please print yourself.''

\end{itemize}

This change in perspective might be more polite, but it is not obvious
that it is useful.  In the examples we have seen so far, it may not
be.  But sometimes shifting responsibility from the functions onto the
objects makes it possible to write more versatile functions, and makes
it easier to maintain and reuse code.

\begin{exercise}
\label{convert}

Rewrite \verb"time_to_int" (from Section~\ref{prototype}) as a method.
It is probably not appropriate to rewrite \verb"int_to_time" as a
method; what object you would invoke it on?

\end{exercise}


\section{Another example}
\index{increment}

Here's a version of {\tt increment} (from Section~\ref{increment})
rewritten as a method:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def increment(self, seconds):
        seconds += self.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
This version assumes that \verb"time_to_int" is written
as a method, as in Exercise~\ref{convert}.  Also, note that
it is a pure function, not a modifier.

Here's how you would invoke {\tt increment}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start.print_time()
09:45:00
>>> end = start.increment(1337)
>>> end.print_time()
10:07:17
\end{verbatim}
%
The subject, {\tt start}, gets assigned to the first parameter,
{\tt self}.  The argument, {\tt 1337}, gets assigned to the
second parameter, {\tt seconds}.

This mechanism can be confusing, especially if you make an error.
For example, if you invoke {\tt increment} with two arguments, you
get:
\index{exception!TypeError}
\index{TypeError}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> end = start.increment(1337, 460)
TypeError: increment() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)
\end{verbatim}
%
The error message is initially confusing, because there are
only two arguments in parentheses.  But the subject is also
considered an argument, so all together that's three.


\section{A more complicated example}

\verb"is_after" (from Exercise~\ref{isafter}) is slightly more complicated
because it takes two Time objects as parameters.  In this case it is
conventional to name the first parameter {\tt self} and the second
parameter {\tt other}:
\index{other (parameter name)}
\index{parameter!other}

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def is_after(self, other):
        return self.time_to_int() > other.time_to_int()
\end{verbatim}
%
To use this method, you have to invoke it on one object and pass
the other as an argument:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> end.is_after(start)
True
\end{verbatim}
%
One nice thing about this syntax is that it almost reads
like English: ``end is after start?''


\section{The init method}
\index{init method}
\index{method!init}

The init method (short for ``initialization'') is
a special method that gets invoked when an object is instantiated.  
Its full name is \verb"__init__" (two underscore characters,
followed by {\tt init}, and then two more underscores).  An
init method for the {\tt Time} class might look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second
\end{verbatim}
%
It is common for the parameters of \verb"__init__"
to have the same names as the attributes.  The statement

\begin{verbatim}
        self.hour = hour
\end{verbatim}
%
stores the value of the parameter {\tt hour} as an attribute
of {\tt self}.
\index{optional parameter}
\index{parameter!optional}
\index{default value}
\index{override}

The parameters are optional, so if you call {\tt Time} with
no arguments, you get the default values.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> time = Time()
>>> time.print_time()
00:00:00
\end{verbatim}
%
If you provide one argument, it overrides {\tt hour}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> time = Time (9)
>>> time.print_time()
09:00:00
\end{verbatim}
%
If you provide two arguments, they override {\tt hour} and
{\tt minute}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> time = Time(9, 45)
>>> time.print_time()
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
And if you provide three arguments, they override all three
default values.


\begin{exercise}
\index{Point class}
\index{class!Point}

Write an init method for the {\tt Point} class that takes
{\tt x} and {\tt y} as optional parameters and assigns
them to the corresponding attributes.
\end{exercise}


\section{The {\tt \_\_str\_\_} method}
\index{str method@\_\_str\_\_ method}
\index{method!\_\_str\_\_}

\verb"__str__" is a special method, like \verb"__init__",
that is supposed to return a string representation of an object.
\index{string representation}

For example, here is a {\tt str} method for Time objects:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __str__(self):
        return '%.2d:%.2d:%.2d' % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second)
\end{verbatim}
%
When you {\tt print} an object, Python invokes the {\tt str} method:
\index{print statement}
\index{statement!print}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> time = Time(9, 45)
>>> print time
09:45:00
\end{verbatim}
%
When I write a new class, I almost always start by writing 
\verb"__init__", which makes it easier to instantiate objects, and 
\verb"__str__", which is useful for debugging.


\begin{exercise}

Write a {\tt str} method for the {\tt Point} class.  Create
a Point object and print it.

\end{exercise}


\section{Operator overloading}
\label{operator.overloading}

By defining other special methods, you can specify the behavior
of operators on user-defined types.  For example, if you define
a method named \verb"__add__" for the {\tt Time} class, you can use the
{\tt +} operator on Time objects.

Here is what the definition might look like:
\index{add method}
\index{method!add}

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __add__(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
And here is how you could use it:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start = Time(9, 45)
>>> duration = Time(1, 35)
>>> print start + duration
11:20:00
\end{verbatim}
%
When you apply the {\tt +} operator to Time objects, Python invokes
\verb"__add__".  When you print the result, Python invokes 
\verb"__str__".  So there is quite a lot happening behind the scenes!
\index{operator overloading}

Changing the behavior of an operator so that it works with
user-defined types is called {\bf operator overloading}.  For every
operator in Python there is a corresponding special method, like 
\verb"__add__".  For more details, see
\url{docs.python.org/ref/specialnames.html}.

\begin{exercise}

Write an {\tt add} method for the Point class.  

\end{exercise}


\section{Type-based dispatch}

In the previous section we added two Time objects, but you
also might want to add an integer to a Time object.  The
following is a version of \verb"__add__"
that checks the type of {\tt other} and invokes either
\verb"add_time" or {\tt increment}:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Time):
            return self.add_time(other)
        else:
            return self.increment(other)

    def add_time(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)

    def increment(self, seconds):
        seconds += self.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)
\end{verbatim}
%
The built-in function {\tt isinstance} takes a value and a
class object, and returns {\tt True} if the value is an instance
of the class.
\index{isinstance function}
\index{function!isinstance}

If {\tt other} is a Time object, \verb"__add__" invokes
\verb"add_time".  Otherwise it assumes that the parameter
is a number and invokes {\tt increment}.  This operation is
called a {\bf type-based dispatch} because it dispatches the
computation to different methods based on the type of the
arguments.
\index{type-based dispatch}
\index{dispatch, type-based}

Here are examples that use the {\tt +} operator with different
types:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> start = Time(9, 45)
>>> duration = Time(1, 35)
>>> print start + duration
11:20:00
>>> print start + 1337
10:07:17
\end{verbatim}
%
Unfortunately, this implementation of addition is not commutative.
If the integer is the first operand, you get
\index{commutativity}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print 1337 + start
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'instance'
\end{verbatim}
%
The problem is, instead of asking the Time object to add an integer,
Python is asking an integer to add a Time object, and it doesn't know
how to do that.  But there is a clever solution for this problem: the
special method \verb"__radd__", which stands for ``right-side add.''
This method is invoked when a Time object appears on the right side of
the {\tt +} operator.  Here's the definition:
\index{radd method}
\index{method!radd}

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Time:

    def __radd__(self, other):
        return self.__add__(other)
\end{verbatim}
%
And here's how it's used:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> print 1337 + start
10:07:17
\end{verbatim}
%

\begin{exercise}

Write an {\tt add} method for Points that works with either a
Point object or a tuple:  

\begin{itemize}

\item If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new
Point whose $x$ coordinate is the sum of the $x$ coordinates of the
operands, and likewise for the $y$ coordinates.

\item If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the
first element of the tuple to the $x$ coordinate and the second
element to the $y$ coordinate, and return a new Point with the result. 

\end{itemize}

\end{exercise}

\section{Polymorphism}

Type-based dispatch is useful when it is necessary, but (fortunately)
it is not always necessary.  Often you can avoid it by writing functions
that work correctly for arguments with different types.
\index{type-based dispatch}
\index{dispatch!type-based}

Many of the functions we wrote for strings will actually
work for any kind of sequence.
For example, in Section~\ref{histogram}
we used {\tt histogram} to count the number of times each letter
appears in a word.

\begin{verbatim}
def histogram(s):
    d = dict()
    for c in s:
        if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] = d[c]+1
    return d
\end{verbatim}
%
This function also works for lists, tuples, and even dictionaries,
as long as the elements of {\tt s} are hashable, so they can be used
as keys in {\tt d}.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t = ['spam', 'egg', 'spam', 'spam', 'bacon', 'spam']
>>> histogram(t)
{'bacon': 1, 'egg': 1, 'spam': 4}
\end{verbatim}
%
Functions that can work with several types are called {\bf polymorphic}.
Polymorphism can facilitate code reuse.  For example, the built-in
function {\tt sum}, which adds the elements of a sequence, works
as long as the elements of the sequence support addition.
\index{polymorphism}

Since Time objects provide an {\tt add} method, they work
with {\tt sum}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> t1 = Time(7, 43)
>>> t2 = Time(7, 41)
>>> t3 = Time(7, 37)
>>> total = sum([t1, t2, t3])
>>> print total
23:01:00
\end{verbatim}
%
In general, if all of the operations inside a function 
work with a given type, then the function works with that type.

The best kind of polymorphism is the unintentional kind, where
you discover that a function you already wrote can be
applied to a type you never planned for.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

It is legal to add attributes to objects at any point in the execution
of a program, but if you are a stickler for type theory, it is a
dubious practice to have objects of the same type with different
attribute sets.  It is usually a good idea to
initialize all of an objects attributes in the init method.
\index{init method}
\index{attribute!initializing}

If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you
can use the built-in function {\tt hasattr} (see Section~\ref{hasattr}).
\index{hasattr function}
\index{function!hasattr}
\index{dict attribute@\_\_dict\_\_ attribute}
\index{attribute!\_\_dict\_\_}

Another way to access the attributes of an object is through the
special attribute \verb"__dict__", which is a dictionary that maps
attribute names (as strings) and values:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> p = Point(3, 4)
>>> print p.__dict__
{'y': 4, 'x': 3}
\end{verbatim}
%
For purposes of debugging, you might find it useful to keep this
function handy:

\begin{verbatim}
def print_attributes(obj):
    for attr in obj.__dict__:
        print attr, getattr(obj, attr)
\end{verbatim}
%
\verb"print_attributes" traverses the items in the object's dictionary
and prints each attribute name and its corresponding value.
\index{traversal!dictionary}
\index{dictionary!traversal}

The built-in function {\tt getattr} takes an object and an attribute
name (as a string) and returns the attribute's value.
\index{getattr function}
\index{function!getattr}


\section{Interface and implementation}

One of the goals of object-oriented design is to make software more
maintainable, which means that you can keep the program working when
other parts of the system change, and modify the program to meet new
requirements.
\index{interface}
\index{implementation}
\index{maintainable}
\index{object-oriented design}

A design principle that helps achieve that goal is to keep
interfaces separate from implementations.  For objects, that means
that the methods a class provides should not depend on how the
attributes are represented.
\index{attribute}

For example, in this chapter we developed a class that represents
a time of day.  Methods provided by this class include
and \verb"time_to_int", \verb"is_after", and \verb"add_time".

We could implement those methods in several ways.  The details of the
implementation depend on how we represent time.  In this chapter, the
attributes of a {\tt Time} object are {\tt hour}, {\tt minute}, and
{\tt second}.

As an alternative, we could replace these attributes with
a single integer representing the number of seconds
since midnight.  This implementation would make some methods,
like \verb"is_after", easier to write, but it makes some methods
harder.

After you deploy a new class, you might discover a better
implementation.  If other parts of the program are using your
class, it might be time-consuming and error-prone to change the
interface.  

But if you designed the interface carefully, you can
change the implementation without changing the interface, which
means that other parts of the program don't have to change.

Keeping the interface separate from the implementation means that
you have to hide the attributes.  Code in other parts of the program
(outside the class definition) should use methods to read
and modify the state of the object.  They should not access the
attributes directly.  This principle is called {\bf information hiding};
see \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding}.
\index{information hiding}

\begin{exercise}

Download the code from this chapter
(\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/Time2.py}).  Change the attributes
of {\tt Time} to be a single integer representing seconds since
midnight.  Then modify the methods (and the function
\verb"int_to_time") to work with the new implementation.  You should
not have to modify the test code in {\tt main}.  When you are done,
the output should be the same as before.  Solution:
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/Time2_soln.py}

\begin{exercise}
\index{Visual module}
\index{module!Visual}
\index{vpython module}
\index{module!vpython}

Visual is a Python module that provides 3-D graphics.  It is
not always included in a Python installation, so you might have
to install it from your software repository or, if it's not there,
from \url{vpython.org}.

The following example creates a 3-D space that is 256 units
wide, long and high, and sets the ``center'' to be the
point $(128,128,128)$.  Then it draws a blue sphere.

\begin{verbatim}
from visual import *

scene.range = (256, 256, 256)
scene.center = (128, 128, 128)

color = (0.1, 0.1, 0.9)          # mostly blue
sphere(pos=scene.center, radius=128, color=color)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt color} is an RGB tuple; that is, the elements are Red-Green-Blue
levels between 0.0 and 1.0 (see
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model}).

If you run this code, you should see a window with a black
background and a blue sphere.  If you drag the middle button
up and down, you can zoom in and out.  You can also rotate
the scene by dragging the right button, but with only one
sphere in the world, it is hard to tell the difference.

The following loop creates a cube of spheres:

\begin{verbatim}
t = range(0, 256, 51)
for x in t:
    for y in t:
        for z in t:
            pos = x, y, z
            sphere(pos=pos, radius=10, color=color)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Put this code in a script and make sure it works for
you.

\item Modify the program so that each sphere in the cube
has the color that corresponds to its position in RGB space.
Notice that the coordinates are in the range 0--255, but
the RGB tuples are in the range 0.0--1.0.
\index{color list}
\index{available colors}

\item Download \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/color_list.py}
and use the function \verb"read_colors" to generate a list
of the available colors on your system, their names and
RGB values.  For each named color draw a sphere in the
position that corresponds to its RGB values.



\end{enumerate}

You can see my solution at \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/color_space.py}.

In this chapter I present classes to represent playing cards,
decks of cards, and poker hands.  If you don't play poker, you can

to; I'll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.

\section{Card objects}

There are fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of
four suits and one of thirteen ranks.  The suits are Spades, Hearts,
Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in bridge).  The ranks are
Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King.  Depending on
the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King
or lower than 2.
\index{rank}
\index{suit}

If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is
obvious what the attributes should be: {\tt rank} and
{\tt suit}.  It is not as obvious what type the attributes
should be.  One possibility is to use strings containing words like
\verb"'Spade'" for suits and \verb"'Queen'" for ranks.  One problem with
this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to
see which had a higher rank or suit.
\index{encode}
\index{encrypt}
\index{map to}
\index{representation}

An alternative is to use integers to {\bf encode} the ranks and suits.
In this context, ``encode'' means that we are going to define a mapping
between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks.  This
kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that
would be ``encryption'').

\newcommand{\mymapsto}{$\mapsto$}

For example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer
codes:

\begin{tabular}{l c l}
Spades & \mymapsto & 3 \\
Hearts & \mymapsto & 2 \\
Diamonds & \mymapsto & 1 \\
Clubs & \mymapsto & 0
\end{tabular}

This code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to
higher numbers, we can compare suits by comparing their codes.

The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks
maps to the corresponding integer, and for face cards:

\begin{tabular}{l c l}
Jack & \mymapsto & 11 \\
Queen & \mymapsto & 12 \\
King & \mymapsto & 13 \\
\end{tabular}

I am using the \mymapsto~symbol to make it clear that these mappings
are not part of the Python program.  They are part of the program
design, but they don't appear explicitly in the code.
\index{Card class}
\index{class!Card}

The class definition for {\tt Card} looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
class Card(object):
    """Represents a standard playing card."""

    def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=2):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank
\end{verbatim}
%
As usual, the init method takes an optional
parameter for each attribute.  The default card is
the 2 of Clubs.
\index{init method}
\index{method!init}

To create a Card, you call {\tt Card} with the
suit and rank of the card you want.

\begin{verbatim}
queen_of_diamonds = Card(1, 12)
\end{verbatim}
%


\section{Class attributes}
\label{class.attribute}
\index{class attribute}
\index{attribute!class}

In order to print Card objects in a way that people can easily
read, we need a mapping from the integer codes to the corresponding
ranks and suits.  A natural way to
do that is with lists of strings.  We assign these lists to {\bf class
attributes}:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Card:

    suit_names = ['Clubs', 'Diamonds', 'Hearts', 'Spades']
    rank_names = [None, 'Ace', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', 
              '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King']

    def __str__(self):
        return '%s of %s' % (Card.rank_names[self.rank],
                             Card.suit_names[self.suit])
\end{verbatim}
%
Variables like \verb"suit_names" and \verb"rank_names", which are
defined inside a class but outside of any method, are called
class attributes because they are associated with the class object 
{\tt Card}.
\index{instance attribute}
\index{attribute!instance}

This term distinguishes them from variables like {\tt suit} and {\tt
  rank}, which are called {\bf instance attributes} because they are
associated with a particular instance.
\index{dot notation}

Both kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation.  For
example, in \verb"__str__", {\tt self} is a Card object,
and {\tt self.rank} is its rank.  Similarly, {\tt Card}
is a class object, and \verb"Card.rank_names" is a
list of strings associated with the class.

Every card has its own {\tt suit} and {\tt rank}, but there
is only one copy of \verb"suit_names" and \verb"rank_names".

Putting it all together, the expression
\verb"Card.rank_names[self.rank]" means ``use the attribute {\tt rank}
from the object {\tt self} as an index into the list \verb"rank_names"
from the class {\tt Card}, and select the appropriate string.''

The first element of \verb"rank_names" is {\tt None} because there
is no card with rank zero.  By including {\tt None} as a place-keeper,
we get a mapping with the nice property that the index 2 maps to the
string \verb"'2'", and so on.  To avoid this tweak, we could have
used a dictionary instead of a list.

With the methods we have so far, we can create and print cards:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> card1 = Card(2, 11)
>>> print card1
Jack of Hearts
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/card1.pdf}}
\caption{Object diagram.}
\label{fig.card1}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig.card1} is a diagram of the {\tt Card} class object
and one Card instance.
\index{state diagram}
\index{diagram!state}
\index{object diagram}
\index{diagram!object}
{\tt Card} is a class object, so it has type {\tt type}.  {\tt
card1} has type {\tt Card}.  (To save space, I didn't draw the
contents of \verb"suit_names" and \verb"rank_names").


\section{Comparing cards}
\label{comparecard}
\index{operator!relational}
\index{relational operator}

For built-in types, there are relational operators
({\tt <}, {\tt >}, {\tt ==}, etc.)
that compare
values and determine when one is greater than, less than, or equal to
another.  For user-defined types, we can override the behavior of
the built-in operators by providing a method named
\verb"__cmp__".  

\verb"__cmp__" takes two parameters, {\tt self} and {\tt other},
and returns a positive number if the first object is greater, a
negative number if the second object is greater, and 0 if they are
equal to each other.
\index{override}
\index{operator overloading}

The correct ordering for cards is not obvious.
For example, which
is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds?  One has a higher
rank, but the other has a higher suit.  In order to compare
cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important.

The answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep
things simple, we'll make the arbitrary choice that suit is more
important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the Diamonds,
and so on.
\index{cmp method@\_\_cmp\_\_ method}
\index{method!\_\_cmp\_\_}

With that decided, we can write \verb"__cmp__":

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Card:

    def __cmp__(self, other):
        # check the suits
        if self.suit > other.suit: return 1
        if self.suit < other.suit: return -1

        # suits are the same... check ranks
        if self.rank > other.rank: return 1
        if self.rank < other.rank: return -1

        # ranks are the same... it's a tie
        return 0    
\end{verbatim}
%
You can write this more concisely using tuple comparison:
\index{tuple!comparison}
\index{comparison!tuple}

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Card:

    def __cmp__(self, other):
        t1 = self.suit, self.rank
        t2 = other.suit, other.rank
        return cmp(t1, t2)
\end{verbatim}
%
The built-in function {\tt cmp} has the same interface as
the method \verb"__cmp__": it takes two values and returns
a positive number if the first is larger, a negative number
if the second is larger, and 0 if they are equal.
\index{cmp function}
\index{function!cmp}


\begin{exercise}

Write a \verb"__cmp__" method for Time objects.  Hint: you
can use tuple comparison, but you also might consider using
integer subtraction.

%    def __cmp__(self, other):
%        return time_to_int(self) - time_to_int(other)

%If {\tt self} is later than {\tt other}, the result is
%a positive number.  If {\tt other} is later, the result
%is negative.  And if {\tt self} and {\tt other} are equal
%(but not necessarily identical)
%the result is zero.

\end{exercise}


\section{Decks}
\index{list!of objects}
\index{deck, playing cards}

Now that we have Cards, the next step is to define Decks.  Since a
deck is made up of cards, it is natural for each Deck to contain a
list of cards as an attribute.
\index{init method}
\index{method!init}

The following is a class definition for {\tt Deck}.  The
init method creates the attribute {\tt cards} and generates
the standard set of fifty-two cards:
\index{composition}
\index{loop!nested}
\index{Deck class}
\index{class!Deck}

\begin{verbatim}
class Deck(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        for suit in range(4):
            for rank in range(1, 14):
                card = Card(suit, rank)
                self.cards.append(card)
\end{verbatim}
%
The easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop.  The outer
loop enumerates the suits from 0 to 3.  The inner loop enumerates the
ranks from 1 to 13.  Each iteration
creates a new Card with the current suit and rank,
and appends it to {\tt self.cards}.
\index{append method}
\index{method!append}


\section{Printing the deck}
\label{printdeck}
\index{str method@\_\_str\_\_ method}
\index{method!\_\_str\_\_}

Here is a \verb"__str__" method for {\tt Deck}:

\begin{verbatim}
#inside class Deck:

    def __str__(self):
        res = []
        for card in self.cards:
            res.append(str(card))
        return '\n'.join(res)
\end{verbatim}
%
This method demonstrates an efficient way to accumulate a large
string: building a list of strings and then using {\tt join}.
The built-in function {\tt str} invokes the \verb"__str__"
method on each card and returns the string representation.
\index{accumulator!string}
\index{string!accumulator}
\index{join method}
\index{method!join}
\index{newline}

Since we invoke {\tt join} on a newline character, the cards
are separated by newlines.  Here's what the result looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> deck = Deck()
>>> print deck
Ace of Clubs
2 of Clubs
3 of Clubs
...
10 of Spades
Jack of Spades
Queen of Spades
King of Spades
\end{verbatim}
%
Even though the result appears on 52 lines, it is
one long string that contains newlines.


\section{Add, remove, shuffle and sort}

To deal cards, we would like a method that
removes a card from the deck and returns it.
The list method {\tt pop} provides a convenient way to do that:
\index{pop method}
\index{method!pop}

\begin{verbatim}
#inside class Deck:

    def pop_card(self):
        return self.cards.pop()
\end{verbatim}
%
Since {\tt pop} removes the {\em last} card in the list, we are
dealing from the bottom of the deck.  In real life ``bottom dealing'' is
frowned upon,
but in this context it's ok.
\index{append method}
\index{method!append}

To add a card, we can use the list method {\tt append}:

\begin{verbatim}
#inside class Deck:

    def add_card(self, card):
        self.cards.append(card)
\end{verbatim}
%
A method like this that uses another function without doing
much real work is sometimes called a {\bf veneer}.  The metaphor
comes from woodworking, where it is common to glue a thin
layer of good quality wood to the surface of a cheaper piece of
wood.
\index{veneer}

In this case we are defining a ``thin'' method that expresses
a list operation in terms that are appropriate for decks.

As another example, we can write a Deck method named {\tt shuffle}
using the function {\tt shuffle} from the {\tt random} module:
\index{random module}
\index{module!random}
\index{shuffle function}
\index{function!shuffle}

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Deck:
            
    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)
\end{verbatim}
%
Don't forget to import {\tt random}.

\begin{exercise}
\index{sort method}
\index{method!sort}

Write a Deck method named {\tt sort} that uses the list method
{\tt sort} to sort the cards in a {\tt Deck}.  {\tt sort} uses
the \verb"__cmp__" method we defined to determine sort order.
\end{exercise}



\section{Inheritance}
\index{inheritance}
\index{object-oriented programming}

The language feature most often associated with object-oriented
programming is {\bf inheritance}.  Inheritance is the ability to
define a new class that is a modified version of an existing
class.
\index{parent class}
\index{child class}
\index{class!child}
\index{subclass}
\index{superclass}

It is called ``inheritance'' because the new class inherits the
methods of the existing class.  Extending this metaphor, the existing
class is called the {\bf parent} and the new class is
called the {\bf child}.

As an example, let's say we want a class to represent a ``hand,''
that is, the set of cards held by one player.  A hand is similar to a
deck: both are made up of a set of cards, and both require operations
like adding and removing cards.

A hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for
hands that don't make sense for a deck.  For example, in poker we
might compare two hands to see which one wins.  In bridge, we might
compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid.

This relationship between classes---similar, but different---lends
itself to inheritance.  

The definition of a child class is like other class definitions,
but the name of the parent class appears in parentheses:
\index{parentheses!parent class in}
\index{parent class}
\index{class!parent}
\index{Hand class}
\index{class!Hand}

\begin{verbatim}
class Hand(Deck):
    """Represents a hand of playing cards."""
\end{verbatim}
%
This definition indicates that {\tt Hand} inherits from {\tt Deck};
that means we can use methods like \verb"pop_card" and \verb"add_card"
for Hands as well as Decks.

{\tt Hand} also inherits \verb"__init__" from {\tt Deck}, but
it doesn't really do what we want: instead of populating the hand
with 52 new cards, the init method for Hands should initialize
{\tt cards} with an empty list.
\index{override}
\index{init method}
\index{method!init}

If we provide an init method in the {\tt Hand} class, it overrides the
one in the {\tt Deck} class:

\begin{verbatim}
# inside class Hand:

    def __init__(self, label=''):
        self.cards = []
        self.label = label
\end{verbatim}
%
So when you create a Hand, Python invokes this init method:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> hand = Hand('new hand')
>>> print hand.cards
[]
>>> print hand.label
new hand
\end{verbatim}
%
But the other methods are inherited from {\tt Deck}, so we can use
\verb"pop_card" and \verb"add_card" to deal a card:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> deck = Deck()
>>> card = deck.pop_card()
>>> hand.add_card(card)
>>> print hand
King of Spades
\end{verbatim}
%
A natural next step is to encapsulate this code in a method
called \verb"move_cards":
\index{encapsulation}

\begin{verbatim}
#inside class Deck:

    def move_cards(self, hand, num):
        for i in range(num):
            hand.add_card(self.pop_card())
\end{verbatim}
%
\verb"move_cards" takes two arguments, a Hand object and the number of
cards to deal.  It modifies both {\tt self} and {\tt hand}, and
returns {\tt None}.

In some games, cards are moved from one hand to another,
or from a hand back to the deck.  You can use \verb"move_cards"
for any of these operations: {\tt self} can be either a Deck
or a Hand, and {\tt hand}, despite the name, can also be a {\tt Deck}.

\begin{exercise}

Write a Deck method called \verb"deal_hands" that takes two
parameters, the number of hands and the number of cards per
hand, and that creates new Hand objects, deals the appropriate
number of cards per hand, and returns a list of Hand objects.

\end{exercise}

Inheritance is a useful feature.  Some programs that would be
repetitive without inheritance can be written more elegantly
with it.  Inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can
customize the behavior of parent classes without having to modify
them.  In some cases, the inheritance structure reflects the natural
structure of the problem, which makes the program easier to
understand.

On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read.
When a method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to find its
definition.  The relevant code may be scattered among several modules.
Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can be
done as well or better without it.  


\section{Class diagrams}
\label{class.diagram}

So far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of
a program, and object diagrams, which show the attributes
of an object and their values.  These diagrams represent a snapshot
in the execution of a program, so they change as the program
runs.

They are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too
detailed.  A class diagram is a more abstract representation
of the structure of a program.  Instead of showing individual
objects, it shows classes and the relationships between them.

There are several kinds of relationship between classes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Objects in one class might contain references to objects
in another class.  For example, each Rectangle contains a reference
to a Point, and each Deck contains references to many Cards.
This kind of relationship is called {\bf HAS-A}, as in, ``a Rectangle
has a Point.''

\item One class might inherit from another.  This relationship
is called {\bf IS-A}, as in, ``a Hand is a kind of a Deck.''

\item One class might depend on another in the sense that changes
in one class would require changes in the other.

\end{itemize}
\index{IS-A relationship}
\index{HAS-A relationship}
\index{class diagram}
\index{diagram!class}

A {\bf class diagram} is a graphical representation of these
relationships.  For example, Figure~\ref{fig.class1} shows the
relationships between {\tt Card}, {\tt Deck} and {\tt Hand}.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figs/class1.pdf}}
\caption{Class diagram.}
\label{fig.class1}
\end{figure}


The arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A
relationship; in this case it indicates that Hand inherits
from Deck.

The standard arrow head represents a HAS-A
relationship; in this case a Deck has references to Card
objects.
\index{multiplicity (in class diagram)}

The star ({\tt *}) near the arrow head is a 
{\bf multiplicity}; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has.
A multiplicity can be a simple number, like {\tt 52}, a range,
like {\tt 5..7} or a star, which indicates that a Deck can
have any number of Cards.

A more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually
contains a {\em list} of Cards, but built-in types
like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.

\begin{exercise}

Read {\tt TurtleWorld.py}, {\tt World.py} and {\tt Gui.py}
and draw a class diagram that shows the relationships among
the classes defined there.

\end{exercise}


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

Inheritance can make debugging a challenge because when you
invoke a method on an object, you might not know which method
will be invoked.
\index{polymorphism}

Suppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects.
You would like it to work with all kinds of Hands, like
PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc.  If you invoke a method like
{\tt shuffle}, you might get the one defined in {\tt Deck},
but if any of the subclasses override this method, you'll
get that version instead.  
\index{flow of execution}

Any time you are unsure about the flow of execution through your
program, the simplest solution is to add print statements at the
beginning of the relevant methods.  If {\tt Deck.shuffle} prints a
message that says something like {\tt Running Deck.shuffle}, then as
the program runs it traces the flow of execution.

As an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an
object and a method name (as a string) and returns the class that
provides the definition of the method:

\begin{verbatim}
def find_defining_class(obj, meth_name):
    for ty in type(obj).mro():
        if meth_name in ty.__dict__:
            return ty
\end{verbatim}
%
Here's an example:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> hand = Hand()
>>> print find_defining_class(hand, 'shuffle')
<class 'Card.Deck'>
\end{verbatim}
%
So the {\tt shuffle} method for this Hand is the one in {\tt Deck}.
\index{mro method}
\index{method!mro}
\index{method resolution order}

\verb"find_defining_class" uses the {\tt mro} method to get the list
of class objects (types) that will be searched for methods.  ``MRO''
stands for ``method resolution order.''
\index{override}
\index{interface}
\index{precondition}
\index{postcondition}

Here's a program design suggestion: whenever you override a method,
the interface of the new method should be the same as the old.  It
should take the same parameters, return the same type, and obey the
same preconditions and postconditions.  If you obey this rule, you
will find that any function designed to work with an instance of a
superclass, like a Deck, will also work with instances of subclasses
like a Hand or PokerHand.

If you violate this rule, your code will collapse like (sorry)
a house of cards.


\section{Data encapsulation}

Chapter~\ref{time} demonstrates a development plan we might call
``object-oriented design.''  We identified objects we needed---{\tt
  Time}, {\tt Point} and {\tt Rectangle}---and defined classes to
represent them.  In each case there is an obvious correspondence
between the object and some entity in the real world (or at least a
mathematical world).
\index{development plan}

But sometimes it is less obvious what objects you need
and how they should interact.  In that case you need a different
development plan.  In the same way that we discovered function
interfaces by encapsulation and generalization, we can discover
class interfaces by {\bf data encapsulation}.
\index{data encapsulation}
\index{encapsulation!data}

Markov analysis, from Section~\ref{markov}, provides a good example.
If you download my code from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/markov.py},
you'll see that it uses two global variables---\verb"suffix_map" and
\verb"prefix"---that are read and written from several functions.

\begin{verbatim}
suffix_map = {}        
prefix = ()            
\end{verbatim}

Because these variables are global
we can only run one analysis
at a time.  If we read two texts, their prefixes and suffixes would
be added to the same data structures (which makes for some interesting
generated text).

To run multiple analyses, and keep them separate, we can encapsulate
the state of each analysis in an object.
Here's what that looks like:

\begin{verbatim}
class Markov(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.suffix_map = {}
        self.prefix = ()    
\end{verbatim}

Next, we transform the functions into methods.  For example,
here's \verb"process_word":

\begin{verbatim}
    def process_word(self, word, order=2):
        if len(self.prefix) < order:
            self.prefix += (word,)
            return

        try:
            self.suffix_map[self.prefix].append(word)
        except KeyError:
            # if there is no entry for this prefix, make one
            self.suffix_map[self.prefix] = [word]

        self.prefix = shift(self.prefix, word)        
\end{verbatim}

Transforming a program like this---changing the design without
changing the function---is another example of refactoring
(see Section~\ref{refactoring}).
\index{refactoring}

This example suggests a development plan for designing objects and
methods:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Start by writing functions that read and write global
variables (when necessary).

\item Once you get the program working, look for associations
between global variables and the functions that use them.

\item Encapsulate related variables as attributes of an object.

\item Transform the associated functions into methods of the new
class.

\end{enumerate}


\begin{exercise}

Download my code from Section~\ref{markov}
(\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/markov.py}), and follow the steps described
above to encapsulate the global variables as attributes of a new class
called {\tt Markov}.  Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/Markov.py}
(note the capital M).

\end{exercise}

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
\label{poker}

The following are the possible hands in poker, in increasing order
of value (and decreasing order of probability):
\index{poker}

\begin{description}

\item[pair:] two cards with the same rank
\vspace{-0.05in}

\item[two pair:] two pairs of cards with the same rank
\vspace{-0.05in}

\item[three of a kind:] three cards with the same rank
\vspace{-0.05in}

\item[straight:] five cards with ranks in sequence (aces can
be high or low, so {\tt Ace-2-3-4-5} is a straight and so is {\tt
10-Jack-Queen-King-Ace}, but {\tt Queen-King-Ace-2-3} is not.)
\vspace{-0.05in}

\item[flush:] five cards with the same suit
\vspace{-0.05in}

\item[full house:] three cards with one rank, two cards with another
\vspace{-0.05in}

\item[four of a kind:] four cards with the same rank
\vspace{-0.05in}

\item[straight flush:] five cards in sequence (as defined above) and
with the same suit
\vspace{-0.05in}

\end{description}
%
The goal of these exercises is to estimate
the probability of drawing these various hands.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download the following files from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code}:

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt Card.py}]: A complete version of the {\tt Card},
{\tt Deck} and {\tt Hand} classes in this chapter.

\item[{\tt PokerHand.py}]: An incomplete implementation of a class
that represents a poker hand, and some code that tests it.

\end{description}
%
\item If you run {\tt PokerHand.py}, it deals seven 7-card poker hands
and checks to see if any of them contains a flush.  Read this
code carefully before you go on.

\item Add methods to {\tt PokerHand.py} named \verb"has_pair",
\verb"has_twopair", etc. that return True or False according to
whether or not the hand meets the relevant criteria.  Your code should
work correctly for ``hands'' that contain any number of cards
(although 5 and 7 are the most common sizes).

\item Write a method named {\tt classify} that figures out
the highest-value classification for a hand and sets the
{\tt label} attribute accordingly.  For example, a 7-card hand
might contain a flush and a pair; it should be labeled ``flush''.

\item When you are convinced that your classification methods are
working, the next step is to estimate the probabilities of the various
hands.  Write a function in {\tt PokerHand.py} that shuffles a deck of
cards, divides it into hands, classifies the hands, and counts the
number of times various classifications appear.

\item Print a table of the classifications and their probabilities.
Run your program with larger and larger numbers of hands until the
output values converge to a reasonable degree of accuracy.  Compare
your results to the values at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_rankings}.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}
\index{Swampy}
\index{TurtleWorld}

This exercise uses TurtleWorld from Chapter~\ref{turtlechap}.
You will write code that makes Turtles play tag.  If you
are not familiar with the rules of tag, see
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game)}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/Wobbler.py} and run it.  You
should see a TurtleWorld with three Turtles.  If you press the
{\sf Run} button, the Turtles wander at random.

\item Read the code and make sure you understand how it works.
The {\tt Wobbler} class inherits from {\tt Turtle}, which means
that the {\tt Turtle} methods {\tt lt}, {\tt rt}, {\tt fd}
and {\tt bk} work on Wobblers.

The {\tt step} method gets invoked by TurtleWorld.  It invokes 
{\tt steer}, which turns the Turtle in the desired direction,
{\tt wobble}, which makes a random turn in proportion to the Turtle's
clumsiness, and {\tt move}, which moves forward a few pixels,
depending on the Turtle's speed.
\index{Tagger}

\item Create a file named {\tt Tagger.py}.  Import everything from
  {\tt Wobbler}, then define a class named {\tt Tagger} that inherits
  from {\tt Wobbler}.  Call \verb"make_world" passing the {\tt
    Tagger} class object as an argument.

\item Add a {\tt steer} method to {\tt Tagger} to override the one in
  {\tt Wobbler}.  As a starting place, write a version that always
  points the Turtle toward the origin.  Hint: use the math function
  {\tt atan2} and the Turtle attributes {\tt x}, {\tt y} and
  {\tt heading}.

\item Modify {\tt steer} so that the Turtles stay in bounds.
  For debugging, you might want to use the {\sf Step} button,
  which invokes {\tt step} once on each Turtle.

\item Modify {\tt steer} so that each Turtle points toward its nearest
  neighbor.  Hint: Turtles have an attribute, {\tt world}, that is a
  reference to the TurtleWorld they live in, and the TurtleWorld has
  an attribute, {\tt animals}, that is a list of all Turtles in the
  world.

\item Modify {\tt steer} so the Turtles play tag.  You can add methods
  to {\tt Tagger} and you can override {\tt steer} and
  \verb"__init__", but you may not modify or override {\tt step}, {\tt
    wobble} or {\tt move}.  Also, {\tt steer} is allowed to change the
  heading of the Turtle but not the position.

Adjust the rules and your {\tt steer} method for good quality play;
for example, it should be possible for the slow Turtle to tag the
faster Turtles eventually.

\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Case study: Tkinter}
\label{tkinter}

\section{GUI}

Most of the programs we have seen so far are text-based, but
many programs use {\bf graphical user interfaces}, also
known as {\bf GUIs}.
\index{GUI}
\index{graphical user interface}
\index{Tkinter}

Python provides several choices for writing GUI-based programs,
including wxPython, Tkinter, and Qt.  Each has pros and cons, which
is why Python has not converged on a standard.

The one I will present in this chapter is Tkinter because I think
it is the easiest to get started with.  Most of the concepts
in this chapter apply to the other GUI modules, too.

There are several books and web pages about Tkinter.  One of
the best online resources is {\em An Introduction to Tkinter}
by Fredrik Lundh.
\index{Gui module}
\index{module!Gui}
\index{Swampy}

I have written a module called {\tt Gui.py} that comes with
Swampy.  It provides a simplified interface to the functions
and classes in Tkinter.  The examples in this chapter are
based on this module.

Here is a simple example that creates and displays a Gui:

To create a GUI, you have to import {\tt Gui} and instantiate
a Gui object:

\begin{verbatim}
from Gui import *

g = Gui()
g.title('Gui')
g.mainloop()
\end{verbatim}
%
When you run this code, a window should appear with an empty gray
square and the title {\sf Gui}.  {\tt mainloop} runs the {\bf event
  loop}, which waits for the user to do something and responds
accordingly.  It is an infinite loop; it runs until the user closes
the window, or presses Control-C, or does something that causes the
program to quit.
\index{event loop}
\index{loop!event}
\index{infinite loop}
\index{loop!infinite}

This Gui doesn't do much because it doesn't have any
{\bf widgets}.  Widgets are the elements that make up a
GUI; they include:
\index{widget}

\begin{description}

\item[Button:] A widget, containing text or an image, that
performs an action when pressed.

\item[Canvas:] A region that can display lines, rectangles,
circles and other shapes.

\item[Entry:] A region where users can type text.

\item[Scrollbar:] A widget that controls the visible part of another
widget.

\item[Frame:] A container, often invisible, that contains other
widgets.

\end{description}

The empty gray square you see when you create a Gui is
a Frame.  When you create a new widget, it is added to this Frame.



\section{Buttons and callbacks}
\index{Button widget}
\index{widget!Button}

The method {\tt bu} creates a Button widget:

\begin{verbatim}
button = g.bu(text='Press me.')
\end{verbatim}
%
The return value from {\tt bu} is a Button object.  The button
that appears in the Frame is a graphical representation of this
object; you can control the button by invoking methods on it.
\index{option}

{\tt bu} takes up to 32 parameters that control the appearance
and function of the button.  These parameters are called
{\bf options}.  Instead of providing values for all 32 options,
you can use keyword arguments, like \verb"text='Press me.'",
to specify only the options you need and use the default
values for the rest.
\index{keyword argument}
\index{argument!keyword}

When you add a widget to the Frame, it gets ``shrink-wrapped;''
that is, the Frame shrinks to the size of the Button.  If you
add more widgets, the Frame grows to accommodate them.
\index{Label widget}
\index{widget!Label}

The method {\tt la} creates a Label widget:

\begin{verbatim}
label = g.la(text='Press the button.')
\end{verbatim}
%
By default, Tkinter stacks the widgets top-to-bottom and centers
them.  We'll see how to override that behavior soon.

If you press the button, you will see that it doesn't do much.
That's because you haven't ``wired it up;'' that is, you haven't
told it what to do!

The option that controls the behavior of a button is {\tt command}.
The value of {\tt command} is a function that gets executed when
the button is pressed.  For example, here is a function that creates
a new Label:

\begin{verbatim}
def make_label():
    g.la(text='Thank you.')
\end{verbatim}
%
Now we can create a button with this function as its command:

\begin{verbatim}
button2 = g.bu(text='No, press me!', command=make_label)
\end{verbatim}
%
When you press this button, it should execute \verb"make_label"
and a new label should appear.
\index{callback}

The value of the {\tt command} option
is a function object, which is known as a {\bf callback} because
after you call {\tt bu} to create the button, the flow of execution
``calls back'' when the user presses the button.
\index{event-driven programming}

This kind of flow is characteristic of {\bf event-driven programming}.
User actions, like button presses and key strokes, are called {\bf
events}.  In event-driven programming, the flow of execution is
determined by user actions rather than by the programmer.  

The challenge of event-driven programming is to construct a set of
widgets and callbacks that work correctly (or at least generate
appropriate error messages) for any sequence of user actions.

\begin{exercise}

Write a program that creates a GUI with a single button.  When the
button is pressed it should create a second button.  When
{\em that} button is pressed, it should create a label that
says, ``Nice job!''.

What happens if you press the buttons more than once?
Solution: \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/button_demo.py}

\end{exercise}


\section{Canvas widgets}
\index{Canvas widget}
\index{widget!Canvas}

One of the most versatile widgets is the Canvas, which creates
a region for drawing lines, circles and other shapes.  If you
did Exercise~\ref{canvas} you are already familiar with canvases.

The method {\tt ca} creates a new Canvas:

\begin{verbatim}
canvas = g.ca(width=500, height=500)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt width} and {\tt height} are the dimensions of the canvas
in pixels.  
\index{config method}
\index{method!config}

After you create a widget, you can still change the values of
the options with the
{\tt config} method.  For example, the {\tt bg} option changes
the background color:

\begin{verbatim}
canvas.config(bg='white')
\end{verbatim}
%
The value of {\tt bg} is a string
that names a color.  The set of legal color names is different
for different implementations of Python, but all implementations
provide at least:

\begin{verbatim}
white   black
red     green    blue   
cyan    yellow   magenta
\end{verbatim}
%
Shapes on a Canvas are called {\bf items}.  For example,
the Canvas method {\tt circle} draws (you guessed it) a circle:
\index{Canvas item}
\index{item!Canvas}

\begin{verbatim}
item = canvas.circle([0,0], 100, fill='red')
\end{verbatim}
%
The first argument is a coordinate pair that specifies the
center of the circle; the second is the radius.
\index{Canvas coordinate}
\index{coordinate!Canvas}

{\tt Gui.py} provides a standard Cartesian coordinate system with
the origin at the center of the Canvas and the positive $y$ axis
pointing up.  This is different from some other graphics systems
where the origin is in the upper left corner, with the $y$ axis
pointing down.

The {\tt fill} option specifies that the circle should be filled
in with red.

The return value from {\tt circle} is an Item object that
provides methods for modifying the item on the canvas.  For
example, you can use {\tt config} to change any of the circle's
options:

\begin{verbatim}
item.config(fill='yellow', outline='orange', width=10)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt width} is the thickness of the outline in pixels;
{\tt outline} is the color.

\begin{exercise}
\label{circle}

Write a program that creates a Canvas and a Button.  When the
user presses the Button, it should draw a circle on the canvas.

\end{exercise}


\section{Coordinate sequences}
\index{coordinate sequence}
\index{sequence!coordinate}

The {\tt rectangle} method takes a sequence of coordinates that
specify opposite corners of the rectangle.  This example
draws a green rectangle with the lower left corner at the origin
and the upper right corner at $(200,100)$:

\begin{verbatim}
canvas.rectangle([[0, 0], [200, 100]], 
                 fill='blue', outline='orange', width=10)
\end{verbatim}
%
This way of specifying corners is called
a {\bf bounding box} because the two points
bound the rectangle.
\index{bounding box}

{\tt oval} takes a bounding box and draws an oval
within the specified rectangle:

\begin{verbatim}
canvas.oval([[0, 0], [200, 100]], outline='orange', width=10)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt line} takes a sequence of coordinates and draws
a line that connects the points.  This example draws two legs
of a triangle:

\begin{verbatim}
canvas.line([[0, 100], [100, 200], [200, 100]], width=10)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt polygon} takes the same arguments, but it draws the last
leg of the polygon (if necessary) and fills it in:

\begin{verbatim}
canvas.polygon([[0, 100], [100, 200], [200, 100]],
               fill='red', outline='orange', width=10)
\end{verbatim}
%


\section{More widgets}
\index{Text widget}
\index{widget!Text}

Tkinter provides two widgets that let users type text: an
Entry, which is a single line, and a Text widget, which has
multiple lines.
\index{Entry widget}
\index{widget!Entry}

{\tt en} creates a new Entry:

\begin{verbatim}
entry = g.en(text='Default text.')
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt text} option allows you to put text into the entry
when it is created.  The {\tt get} method returns the contents
of the Entry (which may have been changed by the user):

\begin{verbatim}
>>> entry.get()
'Default text.'
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt te} creates a Text widget:

\begin{verbatim}
text = g.te(width=100, height=5)
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt width} and {\tt height} are the dimensions of the
widget in characters and lines.

{\tt insert} puts text into the Text widget:

\begin{verbatim}
text.insert(END, 'A line of text.')
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt END} is a special index that indicates the last character in the
Text widget.

You can also specify a character using a dotted index, like {\tt 1.1},
which has the line number before the dot and the column number after.
The following example adds the letters \verb"'nother'" after the first
character of the first line.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> text.insert(1.1, 'nother')
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt get} method reads the text in the widget; it takes a start
and end index as arguments.  The following example returns all the
text in the widget, including the newline character:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> text.get(0.0, END)
'Another line of text.\n'
\end{verbatim}
%
The {\tt delete} method removes text from the widget;
the following example deletes all but the first two characters:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> text.delete(1.2, END)
>>> text.get(0.0, END)
'An\n'
\end{verbatim}
%

\begin{exercise}
\label{circle2}

Modify your solution to Exercise~\ref{circle} by adding an
Entry widget and a second button.  When the user presses the
second button, it should read a color name from the Entry and
use it to change the fill color of the circle.  Use {\tt config}
to modify the existing circle; don't create a new one.

Your program should handle the case where the user tries to
change the color of a circle that hasn't been created, and
the case where the color name is invalid.

You can see my solution at \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/circle_demo.py}.

\end{exercise}


\section{Packing widgets}

So far we have been stacking widgets in a single column, but in most
GUIs the layout is more complicated.  For example,
Figure~\ref{fig.turtleworld} shows a simplified version of
TurtleWorld (see Chapter~\ref{turtlechap}).

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figs/TurtleWorld.pdf}}
\caption{Class diagram.}
\label{fig.turtleworld}
\end{figure}


This section presents the code that creates this GUI, broken into a
series of steps.  You can download the complete example
from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/SimpleTurtleWorld.py}.

At the top level, this GUI contains two widgets---a Canvas and a
Frame---arranged in a row.  So the first step is to create the row.
\index{SimpleTurtleWorld class}
\index{class!SimpleTurtleWorld}

\begin{verbatim}
class SimpleTurtleWorld(TurtleWorld):
    """This class is identical to TurtleWorld, but the code that
    lays out the GUI is simplified for explanatory purposes."""

    def setup(self):
        self.row()
        ...
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt setup} is the function that creates and arranges the widgets.
Arranging widgets in a GUI is called {\bf packing}.
\index{packing widgets}
\index{widget, packing}
\index{Frame widget}
\index{widget!Frame}

{\tt row} creates a row Frame and makes it the ``current Frame.''
Until this Frame is closed or another Frame is created, all
subsequent widgets are packed in a row.

Here is the code that creates the Canvas and the column Frame
that hold the other widgets:

\begin{verbatim}
        self.canvas = self.ca(width=400, height=400, bg='white')
        self.col()
\end{verbatim}
%
The first widget in the column is a grid Frame, which contains
four buttons arranged two-by-two:

\begin{verbatim}
        self.gr(cols=2)
        self.bu(text='Print canvas', command=self.canvas.dump)
        self.bu(text='Quit', command=self.quit)
        self.bu(text='Make Turtle', command=self.make_turtle)
        self.bu(text='Clear', command=self.clear)
        self.endgr()
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt gr} creates the grid; the argument is the number of
columns.  Widgets in the grid are
laid out left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
\index{callback}
\index{bound method}
\index{method, bound}
\index{subject}

The first button uses {\tt self.canvas.dump} as a callback; the second
uses {\tt self.quit}.  These are {\bf bound methods}, which means they
are associated with a particular object.  When they are invoked, they
are invoked on the object.

The next widget in the column is a row Frame that contains
a Button and an Entry:

\begin{verbatim}
        self.row([0,1], pady=30)
        self.bu(text='Run file', command=self.run_file)
        self.en_file = self.en(text='snowflake.py', width=5)
        self.endrow()
\end{verbatim}
%
The first argument to {\tt row} is a list of weights that
determines how extra space is allocated between widgets.  
The list {\tt [0,1]} means that all extra space is allocated
to the second widget, which is the Entry.  If you run this code
and resize the window, you will see that the Entry grows and
the Button doesn't.

The option {\tt pady} ``pads'' this row in the $y$ direction,
adding 30 pixels of space above and below.

{\tt endrow} ends this row of widgets, so subsequent widgets are
packed in the column Frame.  {\tt Gui.py} keeps a stack of Frames:

\begin{itemize}

\item When you use {\tt row}, {\tt col} or {\tt gr} to create a Frame,
it goes on top of the stack and becomes the current Frame.

\item When you use {\tt endrow}, {\tt endcol} or {\tt endgr} to close
a Frame, it gets popped off the stack and the previous Frame on the
stack becomes the current Frame.

\end{itemize} 

The method \verb"run_file" reads the contents of the Entry,
uses it as a filename, reads the contents
and passes it to \verb"run_code".  {\tt self.inter} is an
Interpreter object that knows how to take a string and
execute it as Python code.

\begin{verbatim}
    def run_file(self):
        filename = self.en_file.get()
        fp = open(filename)
        source = fp.read()
        self.inter.run_code(source, filename)
\end{verbatim}
%
The last two widgets are a Text widget and a Button:

\begin{verbatim}
        self.te_code = self.te(width=25, height=10)
        self.te_code.insert(END, 'world.clear()\n')
        self.te_code.insert(END, 'bob = Turtle(world)\n')

        self.bu(text='Run code', command=self.run_text)
\end{verbatim}
%
\verb"run_text" is similar to \verb"run_file" except that it takes
the code from the Text widget instead of from a file:

\begin{verbatim}
    def run_text(self):
        source = self.te_code.get(1.0, END)
        self.inter.run_code(source, '<user-provided code>')
\end{verbatim}
%
Unfortunately, the details of widget layout are different in
other languages, and in different Python modules.
Tkinter alone provides three different mechanisms for arranging
widgets.  These mechanisms are called {\bf geometry managers}.
The one I demonstrated in this section is the ``grid'' geometry
manager; the others are called ``pack'' and ``place''.
\index{geometry manager}

Fortunately, most of the concepts in this section apply to
other GUI modules and other languages.


\section{Menus and Callables}
\index{Menubutton widget}
\index{widget!Menubutton}

A Menubutton is a widget that looks like a button, but when pressed
it pops up a menu.  After the user selects an item, the menu
disappears.

Here is code that creates a color selection Menubutton
(you can download it from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/menubutton_demo.py}):

\begin{verbatim}
g = Gui()
g.la('Select a color:')
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
mb = g.mb(text=colors[0])
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt mb} creates the Menubutton.  Initially, the text on the button is
the name of the default color.  The following loop creates one menu
item for each color:

\begin{verbatim}
for color in colors:
    g.mi(mb, text=color, command=Callable(set_color, color))
\end{verbatim}
%
The first argument of {\tt mi} is the Menubutton these items are
associated with.
\index{callback}
\index{Callable object}
\index{object!Callable}

The {\tt command} option is a Callable object, which is something new.
So far we have seen functions and bound methods used as callbacks,
which works fine if you don't have to pass any arguments to
the function.  Otherwise you have to construct a Callable object
that contains a function, like \verb"set_color", and its arguments,
like {\tt color}.

The Callable object stores a reference to the function and the
arguments as attributes.  Later, when the user clicks on a menu
item, the callback calls the function and passes the stored
arguments.

Here is what \verb"set_color" might look like:

\begin{verbatim}
def set_color(color):
    mb.config(text=color)
    print color
\end{verbatim}
%
When the user selects a menu item and \verb"set_color" is called,
it configures the Menubutton to display the newly-selected color.
It also print the color; if you try this example, you can confirm that
\verb"set_color" is called when you select an item (and {\em not}
called when you create the Callable object).


\section{Binding}
\index{binding}
\index{callback}

A {\bf binding} is an association between a widget, an event and a
callback: when an event (like a button press) happens on a widget, the
callback is invoked.

Many widgets have default bindings.  For example, when you press
a button, the default binding changes the relief of the button
to make it look depressed.  When you release the button, the
binding restores the appearance of the button and invokes the
callback specified with the {\tt command} option.

You can use the {\tt bind} method to override these default
bindings or to add new ones.  For example, this code creates a
binding for a canvas (you can download the code in this
section from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/draggable_demo.py}):

\begin{verbatim}
ca.bind('<ButtonPress-1>', make_circle)
\end{verbatim}
%
The first argument is an event string; this event is triggered
when the user presses the left mouse button.  Other mouse
events include {\tt ButtonMotion}, {\tt ButtonRelease} and
{\tt Double-Button}.
\index{event string}
\index{event handler}

The second argument is an event handler.  An event handler
is a function or bound method, like a callback, but an important
difference is that an event handler takes an Event object as a
parameter.  Here is an example:

\begin{verbatim}
def make_circle(event):
    pos = ca.canvas_coords([event.x, event.y])
    item = ca.circle(pos, 5, fill='red')
\end{verbatim}
%
The Event object contains information about the type of event and
details like the coordinates of the mouse pointer.  In this example
the information we need is
the location of the mouse click.  These
values are in ``pixel coordinates,'' which are defined by the
underlying graphical system.  The method \verb"canvas_coords"
translates them to ``Canvas coordinates,'' which are compatible with
Canvas methods like {\tt circle}.
\index{Event object}
\index{object!Event}

For Entry widgets, it is common to bind the \verb"<Return>" event,
which is triggered when the user presses the {\sf Return} or
{\sf Enter} key.  For example, the following code creates a Button
and an Entry.

\begin{verbatim}
bu = g.bu('Make text item:', make_text)
en = g.en()
en.bind('<Return>', make_text)
\end{verbatim}
%
\verb"make_text" is called when the Button is pressed or when
the user hits {\sf Return} while typing in the Entry.  To make
this work, we need a function that can be called as a command
(with no arguments) or as an event handler (with an Event
as an argument):

\begin{verbatim}
def make_text(event=None):
    text = en.get()
    item = ca.text([0,0], text)
\end{verbatim}
%
\verb"make_text" gets the contents of the Entry and displays
it as a Text item in the Canvas.

It is also possible to create bindings for Canvas items.
The following is a class definition for {\tt Draggable},
which is a child class of {\tt Item} that provides bindings
that implement drag-and-drop capability.
\index{drag-and-drop}

\begin{verbatim}
class Draggable(Item):

    def __init__(self, item):
        self.canvas = item.canvas
        self.tag = item.tag
        self.bind('<Button-3>', self.select)
        self.bind('<B3-Motion>', self.drag)
        self.bind('<Release-3>', self.drop)
\end{verbatim}
%
The init method takes an Item as a parameter.  It copies
the attributes of the Item and then creates bindings for
three events: a button press, button motion, and button release.

The event handler {\tt select} stores the coordinates
of the current event and the original color of the item, then
changes the color to yellow:

\begin{verbatim}
    def select(self, event):
        self.dragx = event.x
        self.dragy = event.y

        self.fill = self.cget('fill')
        self.config(fill='yellow')
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt cget} stands for ``get configuration;'' it takes the name of an
option as a string and returns the current value of that option.

{\tt drag} computes how far the object has moved relative to the
starting place, updates the stored coordinates, and then moves the
item.
\index{update!coordinate}

\begin{verbatim}
    def drag(self, event):
        dx = event.x - self.dragx
        dy = event.y - self.dragy

        self.dragx = event.x
        self.dragy = event.y

        self.move(dx, dy)
\end{verbatim}
%
This computation is done in pixel coordinates; there is no need to
convert to Canvas coordinates.
\index{Canvas coordinate}
\index{coordinate!Canvas}
\index{pixel coordinate}
\index{coordinate!pixel}

Finally, {\tt drop} restores the original color of the item:

\begin{verbatim}
    def drop(self, event):
        self.config(fill=self.fill)
\end{verbatim}
%
You can use the {\tt Draggable} class to add drag-and-drop
capability to an existing item.  For example, here is a modified
version of \verb"make_circle" that uses {\tt circle} to create
an Item and {\tt Draggable} to make it draggable:

\begin{verbatim}
def make_circle(event):
    pos = ca.canvas_coords([event.x, event.y])
    item = ca.circle(pos, 5, fill='red')
    item = Draggable(item)
\end{verbatim}
%
This example demonstrates one of the benefits of inheritance: you can
modify the capabilities of a parent class without modifying its
definition.  This is particularly useful if you want to change
behavior defined in a module you did not write.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}

One of the challenges of GUI programming is keeping track of
which things happen while the GUI is being built and which
things happen later in response to user events.
\index{callback}

For example, when you are setting up a callback, it is a common error
to call the function rather than passing a reference to it:

\begin{verbatim}
def the_callback():
    print 'Called.'

g.bu(text='This is wrong!', command=the_callback())
\end{verbatim}
%
If you run this code, you will see that it calls \verb"the_callback"
immediately, and {\em then} creates the button.  When you press the
button, it does nothing because the return value from 
\verb"the_callback" is {\tt None}.
Usually you do not want to invoke a callback while you are
setting up the GUI; it should only be invoked later in response to
a user event.
\index{flow of execution}
\index{event-driven programming}

Another challenge of GUI programming is that you don't have control
of the flow of execution.  Which parts of the program execute
and their order are determined by user actions.
That means that you have to design your program to work correctly
for any possible sequence of events.

For example, the GUI in Exercise~\ref{circle2} has two widgets:
one creates a Circle item and the other changes the color of the
Circle.  If the user creates the circle and then changes its color,
there's no problem.  But what if the user changes the color of
a circle that doesn't exist yet?  Or creates more than one circle?

As the number of widgets grows, it is increasingly difficult to
imagine all possible sequences of events.  One way to manage this 
complexity is to encapsulate the state of the system in an object
and then consider:

\begin{itemize}

\item What are the possible states?  In the Circle example, we
might consider two states: before and after the user creates the
first circle.

\item In each state, what events can occur?  In the example,
the user can press either of the buttons, or quit.

\item For each state-event pair, what is the desired outcome?
Since there are two states and two buttons, there are four
state-event pairs to consider.

\item What can cause a transition from one state to another?
In this case, there is a transition when the user creates
the first circle.

\end{itemize}

You might also find it useful to define, and check, invariants that
should hold regardless of the sequence of events.
\index{invariant}

This approach to GUI programming can help you write correct
code without taking the time to test every possible sequence
of user events!

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
\index{image viewer}

For this exercise, you will write an image viewer.  Here is
a simple example:

\begin{verbatim}
g = Gui()
canvas = g.ca(width=300)
photo = PhotoImage(file='danger.gif')
canvas.image([0,0], image=photo)
g.mainloop()
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt PhotoImage} reads a file and returns a {\tt PhotoImage} object
that Tkinter can display.  {\tt Canvas.image} puts the image on the
canvas, centered on the given coordinates.  You can also put images on
labels, buttons, and some other widgets:

\begin{verbatim}
g.la(image=photo)
g.bu(image=photo)
\end{verbatim}
%
PhotoImage can only handle a few image formats, like GIF and PPM, 
but we can use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to read other
files.
\index{Python Imaging Library (PIL)}
\index{PIL (Python Imaging Library)}
\index{Image module}
\index{module!Image}

The name of the PIL module is {\tt Image}, but Tkinter defines an
object with the same name.  To avoid the conflict, you can use {\tt
  import...as} like this:

\begin{verbatim}
import Image as PIL
import ImageTk
\end{verbatim}
%
The first line imports {\tt Image} and
gives it the local name {\tt PIL}.  The second
line imports {\tt ImageTk}, which can translate a PIL
image into a Tkinter PhotoImage.  Here's an example:

\begin{verbatim}
image = PIL.open('allen.png')
photo2 = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image)
g.la(image=photo2)
\end{verbatim}
%

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download \verb"image_demo.py", \verb"danger.gif" and \verb"allen.png"
from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code}.  Run \verb"image_demo.py".  You
might have to install {\tt PIL} and {\tt ImageTk}.  
They are probably in your software repository,  but if not
you can get them from \url{pythonware.com/products/pil/}.

\item In \verb"image_demo.py" change the name of the second
PhotoImage from {\tt photo2} to {\tt photo} and run the program
again.  You should see the second PhotoImage but not the first.

The problem is that when you reassign {\tt photo} it overwrites
the reference to the first PhotoImage, which then disappears.  The
same thing happens if you assign a PhotoImage to a local
variable; it disappears when the function ends.

To avoid this problem, you have to store a reference to each
PhotoImage you want to keep.  You can use a global variable, or
store PhotoImages in a data structure or as an attribute of
an object.

This behavior can be frustrating, which is why I am warning
you (and why the example image says ``Danger!'').
\index{bug!worst ever}
\index{worst bug!ever}

\item Starting with this example, write a program that takes
the name of a directory and loops through all the files, displaying
any files that PIL recognizes as images.  You can use a {\tt try}
statement to catch the files PIL doesn't recognize.

When the user clicks on the image, the program should display the next one.

\item PIL provides a variety of methods for manipulating images.
You can read about them at \url{http://pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook}.
As a challenge, choose a few of these methods and provide a
GUI for applying them to images.

\appendix

\chapter{Debugging}

\index{debugging}
Different kinds of errors can occur
in a program, and it is useful to distinguish among them
in order to track them down more quickly:

\begin{itemize}

\item Syntax errors are produced by Python when it is translating the
  source code into byte code.  They usually indicate that there is
  something wrong with the syntax of the program.  Example: Omitting
  the colon at the end of a {\tt def} statement yields the somewhat
  redundant message {\tt SyntaxError: invalid syntax}.

\item Runtime errors are produced by the interpreter if something goes
  wrong while the program is running.  Most runtime error messages
  include information about where the error occurred and what
  functions were executing.  Example: An infinite recursion eventually
  causes the runtime error ``maximum recursion depth exceeded.''

\item Semantic errors are problems with a program that runs without
  producing error messages but doesn't do the right thing.  Example:
  An expression may not be evaluated in the order you expect, yielding
  an incorrect result.

\end{itemize}
\index{syntax error}
\index{runtime error}
\index{semantic error}
\index{error!compile-time}
\index{error!syntax}
\index{error!runtime}
\index{error!semantic}
\index{exception}

The first step in debugging is to figure out which kind of
error you are dealing with.  Although the following sections are
organized by error type, some techniques are
applicable in more than one situation.


\section{Syntax errors}
\index{error message}

Syntax errors are usually easy to fix once you figure out what they
are.  Unfortunately, the error messages are often not helpful.
The most common messages are {\tt SyntaxError: invalid syntax} and
{\tt SyntaxError: invalid token}, neither of which is very informative.

On the other hand, the message does tell you where in the program the
problem occurred.  Actually, it tells you where Python
noticed a problem, which is not necessarily where the error
is.  Sometimes the error is prior to the location of the error
message, often on the preceding line.
\index{incremental development}
\index{development plan!incremental}

If you are building the program incrementally, you should have
a good idea about where the error is.  It will be in the last
line you added.

If you are copying code from a book, start by comparing
your code to the book's code very carefully.  Check every character.
At the same time, remember that the book might be wrong, so
if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might be.

Here are some ways to avoid the most common syntax errors:
\index{syntax}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Make sure you are not using a Python keyword for a variable name.
\index{keyword}

\item Check that you have a colon at the end of the header of every
compound statement, including {\tt for}, {\tt while},
{\tt if}, and {\tt def} statements.
\index{header}
\index{colon}

\item Make sure that any strings in the code have matching
quotation marks.
\index{quotation mark}

\item If you have multiline strings with triple quotes (single or double), make
sure you have terminated the string properly.  An unterminated string
may cause an {\tt invalid token} error at the end of your program,
or it may treat the following part of the program as a string until it
comes to the next string.  In the second case, it might not produce an error
message at all!
\index{multiline string}
\index{string!multiline}

\item An unclosed opening operator---\verb+(+, \verb+{+, or
  \verb+[+---makes Python continue with the next line as part of the
  current statement.  Generally, an error occurs almost immediately in
  the next line.

\item Check for the classic {\tt =} instead of {\tt ==} inside
a conditional.
\index{conditional}

\item Check the indentation to make sure it lines up the way it
is supposed to.  Python can handle space and tabs, but if you mix
them it can cause problems.  The best way to avoid this problem
is to use a text editor that knows about Python and generates
consistent indentation.
\index{indentation}
\index{whitespace}

\end{enumerate}

If nothing works, move on to the next section...


\subsection{I keep making changes and it makes no difference.}

If the interpreter says there is an error and you don't see it, that
might be because you and the interpreter are not looking at the same
code.  Check your programming environment to make sure that the
program you are editing is the one Python is trying to run.

If you are not sure, try putting an obvious and deliberate syntax
error at the beginning of the program.  Now run it again.  If the
interpreter doesn't find the new error, you are not running the
new code.

There are a few likely culprits:

\begin{itemize}

\item You edited the file and forgot to save the changes before
running it again.  Some programming environments do this
for you, but some don't.

\item You changed the name of the file, but you are still running
the old name.

\item Something in your development environment is configured
incorrectly.

\item If you are writing a module and using {\tt import},
make sure you don't give your module the same name as one
of the standard Python modules.
\index{module!reload}
\index{reload function}
\index{function!reload}

\item If you are using {\tt import} to read a module, remember
that you have to restart the interpreter or use {\tt reload}
to read a modified file.  If you import the module again, it
doesn't do anything.

\end{itemize}

If you get stuck and you can't figure out what is going on, one
approach is to start again with a new program like ``Hello, World!,''
and make sure you can get a known program to run.  Then gradually add
the pieces of the original program to the new one.


\section{Runtime errors}

Once your program is syntactically correct,
Python can compile it and at least start running it.  What could
possibly go wrong?


\subsection{My program does absolutely nothing.}

This problem is most common when your file consists of functions and
classes but does not actually invoke anything to start execution.
This may be intentional if you only plan to import this module to
supply classes and functions.

If it is not intentional, make sure that you
are invoking a function to start execution, or execute one from
the interactive prompt.  Also see the ``Flow of Execution'' section
below.


\subsection{My program hangs.}
\index{infinite loop}
\index{infinite recursion}
\index{hanging}

If a program stops and seems to be doing nothing, it is ``hanging.''
Often that means that it is caught in an infinite loop or infinite
recursion.

\begin{itemize}

\item If there is a particular loop that you suspect is the
problem, add a {\tt print} statement immediately before the loop that says
``entering the loop'' and another immediately after that says
``exiting the loop.''

Run the program.  If you get the first message and not the second,
you've got an infinite loop.  Go to the ``Infinite Loop'' section
below.

\item Most of the time, an infinite recursion will cause the program
to run for a while and then produce a ``RuntimeError: Maximum
recursion depth exceeded'' error.  If that happens, go to the
``Infinite Recursion'' section below.

If you are not getting this error but you suspect there is a problem
with a recursive method or function, you can still use the techniques
in the ``Infinite Recursion'' section.

\item If neither of those steps works, start testing other
loops and other recursive functions and methods.

\item If that doesn't work, then it is possible that
you don't understand the flow of execution in your program.
Go to the ``Flow of Execution'' section below.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Infinite Loop}
\index{infinite loop}
\index{loop!infinite}
\index{condition}
\index{loop!condition}

If you think you have an infinite loop and you think you know
what loop is causing the problem, add a {\tt print} statement at
the end of the loop that prints the values of the variables in
the condition and the value of the condition.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
while x > 0 and y < 0 :
    # do something to x
    # do something to y

    print "x: ", x
    print "y: ", y
    print "condition: ", (x > 0 and y < 0)
\end{verbatim}
%
Now when you run the program, you will see three lines of output
for each time through the loop.  The last time through the
loop, the condition should be {\tt false}.  If the loop keeps
going, you will be able to see the values of {\tt x} and {\tt y},
and you might figure out why they are not being updated correctly.


\subsubsection{Infinite Recursion}
\index{infinite recursion}
\index{recursion!infinite}

Most of the time, an infinite recursion will cause the program to run
for a while and then produce a {\tt Maximum recursion depth exceeded}
error.

If you suspect that a function or method is causing an infinite
recursion, start by checking to make sure that there is a base case.
In other words, there should be some condition that will cause the
function or method to return without making a recursive invocation.
If not, then you need to rethink the algorithm and identify a base
case.

If there is a base case but the program doesn't seem to be reaching
it, add a {\tt print} statement at the beginning of the function or method
that prints the parameters.  Now when you run the program, you will see
a few lines of output every time the function or method is invoked,
and you will see the parameters.  If the parameters are not moving
toward the base case, you will get some ideas about why not.


\subsubsection{Flow of Execution}
\index{flow of execution}

If you are not sure how the flow of execution is moving through
your program, add {\tt print} statements to the beginning of each
function with a message like ``entering function {\tt foo},'' where
{\tt foo} is the name of the function.

Now when you run the program, it will print a trace of each
function as it is invoked.


\subsection{When I run the program I get an exception.}
\index{exception}
\index{runtime error}

If something goes wrong during runtime, Python
prints a message that includes the name of the
exception, the line of the program where the problem occurred,
and a traceback.
\index{traceback}

The traceback identifies the function that is currently running,
and then the function that invoked it, and then the function that
invoked {\em that}, and so on.  In other words, it traces the
sequence of function invocations that got you to where you are.  It
also includes the line number in your file where each of these
calls occurs.

The first step is to examine the place in the program where
the error occurred and see if you can figure out what happened.
These are some of the most common runtime errors:

\begin{description}

\item[NameError:]  You are trying to use a variable that doesn't
exist in the current environment.
Remember that local variables are local.  You
cannot refer to them from outside the function where they are defined.
\index{NameError}
\index{TypeError}
\index{exception!NameError}
\index{exception!TypeError}

\item[TypeError:] There are several possible causes:

\begin{itemize}

\item  You are trying to use a value improperly.  Example: indexing
a string, list, or tuple with something other than an integer.
\index{index}

\item There is a mismatch between the items in a format string and
the items passed for conversion.  This can happen if either the number
of items does not match or an invalid conversion is called for.
\index{format operator}
\index{operator!format}

\item You are passing the wrong number of arguments to a function or method.
For methods, look at the method definition and
check that the first parameter is {\tt self}.  Then look at the
method invocation; make sure you are invoking the method on an
object with the right type and providing the other arguments
correctly.

\end{itemize}

\item[KeyError:]  You are trying to access an element of a dictionary
using a key that the dictionary does not contain.
\index{KeyError}
\index{exception!KeyError}
\index{dictionary}

\item[AttributeError:] You are trying to access an attribute or method
that does not exist.  Check the spelling!  You can use
{\tt dir} to list the attributes that do exist.

If an AttributeError indicates that an object has {\tt NoneType},
that means that it is {\tt None}.  One common cause is forgetting
to return a value from a function; if you get to the end of
a function without hitting a {\tt return} statement, it returns
{\tt None}.  Another common cause is using the result from
a list method, like {\tt sort}, that returns {\tt None}.
\index{AttributeError}
\index{exception!AttributeError}

\item[IndexError:] The index you are using
to access a list, string, or tuple is greater than
its length minus one.  Immediately before the site of the error,
add a {\tt print} statement to display
the value of the index and the length of the array.
Is the array the right size?  Is the index the right value?
\index{IndexError}
\index{exception!IndexError}

\end{description}
\index{debugger (pdb)}
\index{Python debugger (pdb)}
\index{pdb (Python debugger)}

The Python debugger ({\tt pdb}) is useful for tracking down
Exceptions because it allows you to examine the state of the
program immediately before the error.  You can read
about {\tt pdb} at \url{docs.python.org/lib/module-pdb.html}.


\subsection{I added so many {\tt print} statements I get inundated with
output.}
\index{print statement}
\index{statement!print}

One of the problems with using {\tt print} statements for debugging
is that you can end up buried in output.  There are two ways
to proceed: simplify the output or simplify the program.

To simplify the output, you can remove or comment out {\tt print}
statements that aren't helping, or combine them, or format
the output so it is easier to understand.

To simplify the program, there are several things you can do.  First,
scale down the problem the program is working on.  For example, if you
are searching a list, search a {\em small} list.  If the program takes
input from the user, give it the simplest input that causes the
problem.
\index{dead code}

Second, clean up the program.  Remove dead code and reorganize the
program to make it as easy to read as possible.  For example, if you
suspect that the problem is in a deeply nested part of the program,
try rewriting that part with simpler structure.  If you suspect a
large function, try splitting it into smaller functions and testing them
separately.
\index{testing!minimal test case}
\index{test case, minimal}

Often the process of finding the minimal test case leads you to the
bug.  If you find that a program works in one situation but not in
another, that gives you a clue about what is going on.

Similarly, rewriting a piece of code can help you find subtle
bugs.  If you make a change that you think shouldn't affect the
program, and it does, that can tip you off.


\section{Semantic errors}
\index{semantic error}
\index{error!semantic}

In some ways, semantic errors are the hardest to debug,
because the interpreter provides no information
about what is wrong.  Only you know what the program is supposed to
do.

The first step is to make a connection between the program
text and the behavior you are seeing.  You need a hypothesis
about what the program is actually doing.  One of the things
that makes that hard is that computers run so fast.

You will often wish that you could slow the program down to human
speed, and with some debuggers you can.  But the time it takes to
insert a few well-placed {\tt print} statements is often short compared to
setting up the debugger, inserting and removing breakpoints, and
``stepping'' the program to where the error is occurring.

\subsection{My program doesn't work.}

You should ask yourself these questions:

\begin{itemize}

\item Is there something the program was supposed to do but
which doesn't seem to be happening?  Find the section of the code
that performs that function and make sure it is executing when
you think it should.

\item Is something happening that shouldn't?  Find code in
your program that performs that function and see if it is
executing when it shouldn't.

\item Is a section of code producing an effect that is not
what you expected?  Make sure that you understand the code in
question, especially if it involves invocations to functions or methods in
other Python modules.  Read the documentation for the functions you invoke.
Try them out by writing simple test cases and checking the results.

\end{itemize}

In order to program, you need to have a mental model of how
programs work.  If you write a program that doesn't do what you expect,
very often the problem is not in the program; it's in your mental
model.
\index{model, mental}
\index{mental model}

The best way to correct your mental model is to break the program
into its components (usually the functions and methods) and test
each component independently.  Once you find the discrepancy
between your model and reality, you can solve the problem.

Of course, you should be building and testing components as you
develop the program.  If you encounter a problem,
there should be only a small amount of new code
that is not known to be correct.


\subsection{I've got a big hairy expression and it doesn't
do what I expect.}
\index{expression!big and hairy}
\index{big, hairy expression}

Writing complex expressions is fine as long as they are readable,
but they can be hard to debug.  It is often a good idea to
break a complex expression into a series of assignments to
temporary variables.

For example:

\begin{verbatim}
self.hands[i].addCard(self.hands[self.findNeighbor(i)].popCard())
\end{verbatim}
%
This can be rewritten as:

\begin{verbatim}
neighbor = self.findNeighbor(i)
pickedCard = self.hands[neighbor].popCard()
self.hands[i].addCard(pickedCard)
\end{verbatim}
%
The explicit version is easier to read because the variable
names provide additional documentation, and it is easier to debug
because you can check the types of the intermediate variables
and display their values.
\index{temporary variable}
\index{variable!temporary}
\index{order of operations}
\index{precedence}

Another problem that can occur with big expressions is
that the order of evaluation may not be what you expect.
For example, if you are translating the expression
$\frac{x}{2 \pi}$ into Python, you might write:

\begin{verbatim}
y = x / 2 * math.pi
\end{verbatim}
%
That is not correct because multiplication and division have
the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right.
So this expression computes $x \pi / 2$.

A good way to debug expressions is to add parentheses to make
the order of evaluation explicit:

\begin{verbatim}
 y = x / (2 * math.pi)
\end{verbatim}
%
Whenever you are not sure of the order of evaluation, use
parentheses.  Not only will the program be correct (in the sense
of doing what you intended), it will also be more readable for
other people who haven't memorized the rules of precedence.


\subsection{I've got a function or method that doesn't return what I
expect.}
\index{return statement}
\index{statement!return}

If you have a {\tt return} statement with a complex expression,
you don't have a chance to print the {\tt return} value before
returning.  Again, you can use a temporary variable.  For
example, instead of:

\begin{verbatim}
return self.hands[i].removeMatches()
\end{verbatim}
%
you could write:

\begin{verbatim}
count = self.hands[i].removeMatches()
return count
\end{verbatim}
%
Now you have the opportunity to display the value of
{\tt count} before returning.


\subsection{I'm really, really stuck and I need help.}

First, try getting away from the computer for a few minutes.
Computers emit waves that affect the brain, causing these
symptoms:

\begin{itemize}

\item Frustration and rage.
\index{frustration}
\index{rage}
\index{debugging!emotional response}
\index{emotional debugging}

\item Superstitious beliefs (``the computer hates me'') and
magical thinking (``the program only works when I wear my
hat backward'').
\index{debugging!superstition}
\index{superstitious debugging}

\item Random walk programming (the attempt to program by writing
every possible program and choosing the one that does the right
thing).
\index{random walk programming}
\index{development plan!random walk programming}

\end{itemize}

If you find yourself suffering from any of these symptoms, get
up and go for a walk.  When you are calm, think about the program.
What is it doing?  What are some possible causes of that
behavior?  When was the last time you had a working program,
and what did you do next?

Sometimes it just takes time to find a bug.  I often find bugs
when I am away from the computer and let my mind wander.  Some
of the best places to find bugs are trains, showers, and in bed,
just before you fall asleep.


\subsection{No, I really need help.}

It happens.  Even the best programmers occasionally get stuck.
Sometimes you work on a program so long that you can't see the
error.  A fresh pair of eyes is just the thing.

Before you bring someone else in, make sure you are prepared.
Your program should be as simple
as possible, and you should be working on the smallest input
that causes the error.  You should have {\tt print} statements in the
appropriate places (and the output they produce should be
comprehensible).  You should understand the problem well enough
to describe it concisely.

When you bring someone in to help, be sure to give
them the information they need:

\begin{itemize}

\item If there is an error message, what is it
and what part of the program does it indicate?

\item What was the last thing you did before this error occurred?
What were the last lines of code that you wrote, or what is
the new test case that fails?

\item What have you tried so far, and what have you learned?

\end{itemize}

When you find the bug, take a second to think about what you
could have done to find it faster.  Next time you see something
similar, you will be able to find the bug more quickly.

Remember, the goal is not just to make the program
work.  The goal is to learn how to make the program work.


\chapter{Analysis of Algorithms}

\begin{quote}
This appendix is an edited excerpt from {\it Think Complexity}, by
Allen B. Downey, also published by O'Reilly Media (2011).  When you
are done with this book, you might want to move on to that one.
\end{quote}

{\bf Analysis of algorithms} is a branch of computer science that
studies the performance of algorithms, especially their run time and
space requirements.  See
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms}.
\index{algorithm} \index{analysis of algorithms}

The practical goal of algorithm analysis is to predict the performance
of different algorithms in order to guide design decisions.

During the 2008 United States Presidential Campaign, candidate
Barack Obama was asked to perform an impromptu analysis when
he visited Google.  Chief executive Eric Schmidt jokingly asked him
for ``the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit integers.''
Obama had apparently been tipped off, because he quickly
replied, ``I think the bubble sort would be the wrong way to go.''
See \url{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8}.
\index{Obama, Barack}
\index{Schmidt, Eric}
\index{bubble sort}

This is true: bubble sort is conceptually simple but slow for
large datasets.  The answer Schmidt was probably looking for is
``radix sort'' (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort})\footnote{
But if you get a question like this in an interview, I think
a better answer is, ``The fastest way to sort a million integers
is to use whatever sort function is provided by the language
I'm using.  Its performance is good enough for the vast majority
of applications, but if it turned out that my application was too
slow, I would use a profiler to see where the time was being
spent.  If it looked like a faster sort algorithm would have
a significant effect on performance, then I would look
around for a good implementation of radix sort.''}.
\index{radix sort}

The goal of algorithm analysis is to make meaningful
comparisons between algorithms, but there are some problems:
\index{comparing algorithms}

\begin{itemize}

\item The relative performance of the algorithms might
depend on characteristics of the hardware, so one algorithm
might be faster on Machine A, another on Machine B.
The general solution to this problem is to specify a
{\bf machine model} and analyze the number of steps, or
operations, an algorithm requires under a given model.
\index{machine model}

\item Relative performance might depend on the details of
the dataset.  For example, some sorting
algorithms run faster if the data are already partially sorted;
other algorithms run slower in this case.
A common way to avoid this problem is to analyze the
{\bf worst case} scenario.  It is sometimes useful to
analyze average case performance, but that's usually harder,
and it might not be obvious what set of cases to average over.
\index{worst case}
\index{average case}

\item Relative performance also depends on the size of the
problem.  A sorting algorithm that is fast for small lists
might be slow for long lists.
The usual solution to this problem is to express run time
(or number of operations) as a function of problem size,
and to compare the functions {\bf asymptotically} as the problem
size increases.
\index{asymptotic analysis}

\end{itemize}

The good thing about this kind of comparison that it lends
itself to simple classification of algorithms.  For example,
if I know that the run time of Algorithm A tends to be
proportional to the size of the input, $n$, and Algorithm B
tends to be proportional to $n^2$, then I
expect A to be faster than B for large values of $n$.

This kind of analysis comes with some caveats, but we'll get
to that later.


\section{Order of growth}

Suppose you have analyzed two algorithms and expressed
their run times in terms of the size of the input:
Algorithm A takes $100n+1$ steps to solve a problem with
size $n$; Algorithm B takes $n^2 + n + 1$ steps.
\index{order of growth}

The following table shows the run time of these algorithms
for different problem sizes:

\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|}
\hline
Input     &   Run time of     & Run time of \\
size      &   Algorithm A     & Algorithm B \\
\hline
10        &   1 001           & 111         \\
100       &   10 001          & 10 101         \\
1 000     &   100 001         & 1 001 001         \\
10 000    &   1 000 001       & $> 10^{10}$         \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

At $n=10$, Algorithm A looks pretty bad; it takes almost 10 times
longer than Algorithm B.  But for $n=100$ they are about the same, and
for larger values A is much better.

The fundamental reason is that for large values of $n$, any function
that contains an $n^2$ term will grow faster than a function whose
leading term is $n$.  The {\bf leading term} is the term with the
highest exponent.
\index{leading term}
\index{exponent}

For Algorithm A, the leading term has a large coefficient, 100, which
is why B does better than A for small $n$.  But regardless of the
coefficients, there will always be some value of $n$ where
$a n^2 > b n$.
\index{leading coefficient}

The same argument applies to the non-leading terms.  Even if the run
time of Algorithm A were $n+1000000$, it would still be better than
Algorithm B for sufficiently large $n$.

In general, we expect an algorithm with a smaller leading term to be a
better algorithm for large problems, but for smaller problems, there
may be a {\bf crossover point} where another algorithm is better.  The
location of the crossover point depends on the details of the
algorithms, the inputs, and the hardware, so it is usually ignored for
purposes of algorithmic analysis.  But that doesn't mean you can forget
about it.
\index{crossover point}

If two algorithms have the same leading order term, it is hard to say
which is better; again, the answer depends on the details.  So for
algorithmic analysis, functions with the same leading term
are considered equivalent, even if they have different coefficients.

An {\bf order of growth} is a set of functions whose asymptotic growth
behavior is considered equivalent.  For example, $2n$, $100n$ and $n+1$ 
belong to the same order of growth, which is written $O(n)$ in
{\bf Big-Oh notation} and often called {\bf linear} because every function
in the set grows linearly with $n$.
\index{big-oh notation}
\index{linear growth}

All functions with the leading term $n^2$ belong to $O(n^2)$; they are
{\bf quadratic}, which is a fancy word for functions with the
leading term $n^2$.
\index{quadratic growth}

The following table shows some of the orders of growth that
appear most commonly in algorithmic analysis,
in increasing order of badness.
\index{badness}

\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|}
\hline
Order of     &   Name      \\
growth       &               \\
\hline
$O(1)$             & constant \\
$O(\log_b n)$      & logarithmic (for any $b$) \\
$O(n)$             & linear \\
$O(n \log_b n)$    & ``en log en'' \\
$O(n^2)$           & quadratic     \\
$O(n^3)$           & cubic     \\
$O(c^n)$           & exponential (for any $c$)    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

For the logarithmic terms, the base of the logarithm doesn't matter;
changing bases is the equivalent of multiplying by a constant, which
doesn't change the order of growth.  Similarly, all exponential
functions belong to the same order of growth regardless of the base of
the exponent.
Exponential functions grow very quickly, so exponential algorithms are
only useful for small problems.
\index{logarithmic growth}
\index{exponential growth}


\begin{exercise}

Read the Wikipedia page on Big-Oh notation at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation} and
answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the order of growth of $n^3 + n^2$?
What about $1000000 n^3 + n^2$?
What about $n^3 + 1000000 n^2$?

\item What is the order of growth of $(n^2 + n) \cdot (n + 1)$?  Before
  you start multiplying, remember that you only need the leading term.

\item If $f$ is in $O(g)$, for some unspecified function $g$, what can
  we say about $af+b$?

\item If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in $O(g)$, what can we say about $f_1 + f_2$?

\item If  $f_1$ is in $O(g)$
and $f_2$ is in $O(h)$,
what can we say about  $f_1 + f_2$?

\item If  $f_1$ is in $O(g)$ and $f_2$ is $O(h)$,
what can we say about  $f_1 \cdot f_2$?
\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

Programmers who care about performance often find this kind of
analysis hard to swallow.  They have a point: sometimes the
coefficients and the non-leading terms make a real difference.
Sometimes the details of the hardware, the programming language, and
the characteristics of the input make a big difference.  And for small
problems asymptotic behavior is irrelevant.
\index{practical analysis of algorithms}

But if you keep those caveats in mind, algorithmic analysis is a
useful tool.  At least for large problems, the ``better'' algorithms
is usually better, and sometimes it is {\em much} better.  The
difference between two algorithms with the same order of growth is
usually a constant factor, but the difference between a good algorithm
and a bad algorithm is unbounded!
\index{unbounded}


\section{Analysis of basic Python operations}

Most arithmetic operations are constant time; multiplication
usually takes longer than addition and subtraction, and division
takes even longer, but these run times don't
depend on the magnitude of the operands.  Very large integers
are an exception; in that case the run time increases
with the number of digits.
\index{analysis of primitives}

Indexing operations---reading or writing elements in a sequence
or dictionary---are also constant time, regardless of the size
of the data structure.
\index{indexing}

A {\tt for} loop that traverses a sequence or dictionary is
usually linear, as long as all of the operations in the body
of the loop are constant time.  For example, adding up the
elements of a list is linear:

\begin{verbatim}
    total = 0
    for x in t:
        total += x
\end{verbatim}

The built-in function {\tt sum} is also linear because it does
the same thing, but it tends to be faster because it is a more
efficient implementation; in the language of algorithmic analysis,
it has a smaller leading coefficient.

If you use the same loop to ``add'' a list of strings, the
run time is quadratic
because string concatenation is linear.
\index{string concatenation}

The string method {\tt join} is usually faster because it is
linear in the total length of the strings.
\index{join@{\tt join}}

As a rule of thumb, if the body of a loop is in $O(n^a)$ then
the whole loop is in $O(n^{a+1})$.  The exception is if you can
show that the loop exits after a constant number of iterations.
If a loop runs $k$ times regardless of $n$, then
the loop is in $O(n^a)$, even for large $k$.

Multiplying by $k$ doesn't change the order of growth, but neither
does dividing.  So if the body of a loop is in $O(n^a)$ and it runs
$n/k$ times, the loop is in $O(n^{a+1})$, even for large $k$.

Most string and tuple operations are linear, except indexing and {\tt
  len}, which are constant time.  The built-in functions {\tt min} and
{\tt max} are linear.  The run-time of a slice operation is
proportional to the length of the output, but independent of the size
of the input.
\index{string methods}
\index{tuple methods}

All string methods are linear, but if the lengths of
the strings are bounded by a constant---for example, operations on single
characters---they are considered constant time.

Most list methods are linear, but there are some exceptions:
\index{list methods}

\begin{itemize}

\item Adding an element to the end of a list is constant time on
average; when it runs out of room it occasionally gets copied
to a bigger location, but the total time for $n$ operations
is $O(n)$, so we say that the ``amortized'' time for one
operation is $O(1)$.

\item Removing an element from the end of a list is constant time.

\item Sorting is $O(n \log n)$.
\index{sorting}

\end{itemize}

Most dictionary operations and methods are constant time, but
there are some exceptions:
\index{dictionary methods}

\begin{itemize}

\item The run time of {\tt copy} is proportional to the number of
  elements, but not the size of the elements (it copies references,
  not the elements themselves).

\item The run time of {\tt update} is
  proportional to the size of the dictionary passed as a parameter,
  not the dictionary being updated.

\item {\tt keys}, {\tt values} and {\tt items} are linear because they
  return new lists; {\tt iterkeys}, {\tt itervalues} and {\tt
    iteritems} are constant time because they return iterators.  But
  if you loop through the iterators, the loop will be linear.  Using
  the ``iter'' functions saves some overhead, but it doesn't change
  the order of growth unless the number of items you access is
  bounded.

\end{itemize}

The performance of dictionaries is one of the minor miracles of
computer science.  We will see how they work in
Section~\ref{hashtable}.


\begin{exercise}

Read the Wikipedia page on sorting algorithms at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm} and answer
the following questions:
\index{sorting}

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is a ``comparison sort?'' What is the best worst-case order
  of growth for a comparison sort?  What is the best worst-case order
  of growth for any sort algorithm?
\index{comparison sort}

\item What is the order of growth of bubble sort, and why does Barack
  Obama think it is ``the wrong way to go?''

\item What is the order of growth of radix sort?  What preconditions
  do we need to use it?

\item What is a stable sort and why might it matter in practice?
\index{stable sort}

\item What is the worst sorting algorithm (that has a name)?

\item What sort algorithm does the C library use?  What sort algorithm
  does Python use?  Are these algorithms stable?  You might have to
  Google around to find these answers.

\item Many of the non-comparison sorts are linear, so why does does
  Python use an $O(n \log n)$ comparison sort?

\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}


\section{Analysis of search algorithms}

A {\bf search} is an algorithm that takes a collection and a target
item and determines whether the target is in the collection, often
returning the index of the target.
\index{search}

The simplest search algorithm is a ``linear search,'' which traverses
the items of the collection in order, stopping if it finds the target.
In the worst case it has to traverse the entire collection, so the run
time is linear.
\index{linear search}

The {\tt in} operator for sequences uses a linear search; so do string
methods like {\tt find} and {\tt count}.
\index{in@{\tt in} operator}

If the elements of the sequence are in order, you can use a {\bf
  bisection search}, which is $O(\log n)$.  Bisection search is
similar to the algorithm you probably use to look a word up in a
dictionary (a real dictionary, not the data structure).  Instead of starting at
the beginning and checking each item in order, you start with the item
in the middle and check whether the word you are looking for comes
before or after.  If it comes before, then you search the first half
of the sequence.  Otherwise you search the second half.  Either way,
you cut the number of remaining items in half.  \index{bisection
  search}

If the sequence has 1,000,000 items, it will take about 20 steps to
find the word or conclude that it's not there.  So that's about 50,000
times faster than a linear search.

\begin{exercise}

Write a function called {\tt bisection} that takes a sorted list
and a target value and returns the index of the value
in the list, if it's there, or {\tt None} if it's not.
\index{bisect@{\tt bisect} module}

\index{bisect module}
\index{module!bisect}

Or you could read the documentation of the {\tt bisect} module
and use that!

\end{exercise}

Bisection search can be much faster than linear search, but
it requires the sequence to be in order, which might require
extra work.

There is another data structure, called a {\bf hashtable} that
is even faster---it can do a search in constant time---and it
doesn't require the items to be sorted.  Python dictionaries
are implemented using hashtables, which is why most dictionary
operations, including the {\tt in} operator, are constant time.


\section{Hashtables}
\label{hashtable}

To explain how hashtables work and why their performance is so
good, I start with a simple implementation of a map and
gradually improve it until it's a hashtable.
\index{hashtable}

I use Python to demonstrate these implementations, but in real
life you wouldn't write code like this in Python; you would just use a
dictionary!  So for the rest of this chapter, you have to imagine that
dictionaries don't exist and you want to implement a data structure
that maps from keys to values.  The operations you have to
implement are:

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt add(k, v)}:] Add a new item that maps from key {\tt k}
to value {\tt v}.  With a Python dictionary, {\tt d}, this operation
is written {\tt d[k] = v}.

\item[{\tt get(target)}:] Look up and return the value that corresponds
to key {\tt target}.  With a Python dictionary, {\tt d}, this operation
is written {\tt d[target]} or {\tt d.get(target)}.

\end{description}

For now, I assume that each key only appears once.
The simplest implementation of this interface uses a list of
tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair.
\index{LinearMap@{\tt LinearMap}}

\begin{verbatim}
class LinearMap(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def add(self, k, v):
        self.items.append((k, v))

    def get(self, k):
        for key, val in self.items:
            if key == k:
                return val
        raise KeyError
\end{verbatim}

{\tt add} appends a key-value tuple to the list of items, which
takes constant time.

{\tt get} uses a {\tt for} loop to search the list:
if it finds the target key it returns the corresponding value;
otherwise it raises a {\tt KeyError}.
So {\tt get} is linear.
\index{KeyError@{\tt KeyError}}

An alternative is to keep the list sorted by key.  Then {\tt get}
could use a bisection search, which is $O(\log n)$.  But inserting a
new item in the middle of a list is linear, so this might not be the
best option.  There are other data structures (see
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree})  that can implement {\tt
  add} and {\tt get} in log time, but that's still not as good as
constant time, so let's move on.
\index{red-black tree}

One way to improve {\tt LinearMap} is to break the list of key-value
pairs into smaller lists.  Here's an implementation called
{\tt BetterMap}, which is a list of 100 LinearMaps.  As we'll see
in a second, the order of growth for {\tt get} is still linear,
but {\tt BetterMap} is a step on the path toward hashtables:
\index{BetterMap@{\tt BetterMap}}

\begin{verbatim}
class BetterMap(object):

    def __init__(self, n=100):
        self.maps = []
        for i in range(n):
            self.maps.append(LinearMap())

    def find_map(self, k):
        index = hash(k) % len(self.maps)
        return self.maps[index]

    def add(self, k, v):
        m = self.find_map(k)
        m.add(k, v)

    def get(self, k):
        m = self.find_map(k)
        return m.get(k)
\end{verbatim}

\verb"__init__" makes a list of {\tt n} {\tt LinearMap}s.

\verb"find_map" is used by
{\tt add} and {\tt get}
to figure out which map to put the
new item in, or which map to search.

\verb"find_map" uses the built-in function {\tt hash}, which takes
almost any Python object and returns an integer.  A limitation of this
implementation is that it only works with hashable keys.  Mutable
types like lists and dictionaries are unhashable.
\index{hash function}

Hashable objects that are considered equal return the same hash value,
but the converse is not necessarily true: two different objects
can return the same hash value.

\verb"find_map" uses the modulus operator to wrap the hash values
into the range from 0 to {\tt len(self.maps)}, so the result is a legal
index into the list.  Of course, this means that many different
hash values will wrap onto the same index.  But if the hash function
spreads things out pretty evenly (which is what hash functions
are designed to do), then we expect $n/100$ items per LinearMap.

Since the run time of {\tt LinearMap.get} is proportional to the
number of items, we expect BetterMap to be about 100 times faster
than LinearMap.  The order of growth is still linear, but the
leading coefficient is smaller.  That's nice, but still not
as good as a hashtable.

Here (finally) is the crucial idea that makes hashtables fast: if you
can keep the maximum length of the LinearMaps bounded, {\tt
  LinearMap.get} is constant time.  All you have to do is keep track
of the number of items and when the number of
items per LinearMap exceeds a threshold, resize the hashtable by
adding more LinearMaps.
\index{bounded}

Here is an implementation of a hashtable:
\index{HashMap}

\begin{verbatim}
class HashMap(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.maps = BetterMap(2)
        self.num = 0

    def get(self, k):
        return self.maps.get(k)

    def add(self, k, v):
        if self.num == len(self.maps.maps):
            self.resize()

        self.maps.add(k, v)
        self.num += 1

    def resize(self):
        new_maps = BetterMap(self.num * 2)

        for m in self.maps.maps:
            for k, v in m.items:
                new_maps.add(k, v)

        self.maps = new_maps
\end{verbatim}

Each {\tt HashMap} contains a {\tt BetterMap}; \verb"__init__" starts
with just 2 LinearMaps and initializes {\tt num}, which keeps track of
the number of items.

{\tt get} just dispatches to {\tt BetterMap}.  The real work happens
in {\tt add}, which checks the number of items and the size of the
{\tt BetterMap}: if they are equal, the average number of items per
LinearMap is 1, so it calls {\tt resize}.

{\tt resize} make a new {\tt BetterMap}, twice as big as the previous
one, and then ``rehashes'' the items from the old map to the new.

Rehashing is necessary because changing the number of LinearMaps
changes the denominator of the modulus operator in
\verb"find_map".  That means that some objects that used
to wrap into the same LinearMap will get split up (which is
what we wanted, right?).
\index{rehashing}

Rehashing is linear, so
{\tt resize} is linear, which might seem bad, since I promised
that {\tt add} would be constant time.  But remember that
we don't have to resize every time, so {\tt add} is usually
constant time and only occasionally linear.  The total amount
of work to run {\tt add} $n$ times is proportional to $n$,
so the average time of each {\tt add} is constant time!
\index{constant time}

To see how this works, think about starting with an empty
HashTable and adding a sequence of items.  We start with 2 LinearMaps,
so the first 2 adds are fast (no resizing required).  Let's
say that they take one unit of work each.  The next add
requires a resize, so we have to rehash the first two
items (let's call that 2 more units of work) and then
add the third item (one more unit).  Adding the next item
costs 1 unit, so the total so far is
6 units of work for 4 items.

The next {\tt add} costs 5 units, but the next three
are only one unit each, so the total is 14 units for the
first 8 adds.

The next {\tt add} costs 9 units, but then we can add 7 more
before the next resize, so the total is 30 units for the
first 16 adds.

After 32 adds, the total cost is 62 units, and I hope you are starting
to see a pattern.  After $n$ adds, where $n$ is a power of two, the
total cost is $2n-2$ units, so the average work per add is
a little less than 2 units.  When $n$ is a power of two, that's
the best case; for other values of $n$ the average work is a little
higher, but that's not important.  The important thing is that it
is $O(1)$.
\index{average cost}

Figure~\ref{fig.hash} shows how this works graphically.  Each
block represents a unit of work.  The columns show the total
work for each add in order from left to right: the first two
{\tt adds} cost 1 units, the third costs 3 units, etc.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figs/towers.pdf}}
\caption{The cost of a hashtable add.\label{fig.hash}}
\end{figure}

The extra work of rehashing appears as a sequence of increasingly
tall towers with increasing space between them.  Now if you knock
over the towers, amortizing the cost of resizing over all
adds, you can see graphically that the total cost after $n$
adds is $2n - 2$.

An important feature of this algorithm is that when we resize the
HashTable it grows geometrically; that is, we multiply the size by a
constant.  If you increase the size
arithmetically---adding a fixed number each time---the average time
per {\tt add} is linear.
\index{geometric resizing}

You can download my implementation of HashMap from
\url{http://thinkpython/code/Map.py}, but remember that there
is no reason to use it; if you want a map, just use a Python dictionary.






\chapter{Lumpy}
\label{lumpy}

Throughout the book, I have used diagrams to represent the state of
running programs.
\index{Lumpy}

In Section~\ref{variables}, we used a state diagram to show the names
and values of variables.  In Section~\ref{stackdiagram} I introduced a
stack diagram, which shows one frame for each function call.  Each
frame shows the parameters and local variables for the function or
method.  Stack diagrams for recursive functions appear in
Section~\ref{recursive.stack} and Section~\ref{more.recursion}.
\index{stack diagram} \index{diagram!stack}
\index{state diagram} \index{diagram!state}

Section~\ref{mutable} shows what a list looks like in a state diagram,
Section~\ref{invert} shows what a dictionary looks like, and
Section~\ref{dictuple} shows two ways to represent tuples.

Section~\ref{attributes} introduces object diagrams, which show the
state of an object's attributes, and their attributes, and so on.
Section~\ref{rectangles} has object diagrams for Rectangles and
their embedded Points.  Section~\ref{time.object} shows the state
of a Time object.
Section~\ref{class.attribute} has a diagram that includes a class
object and an instance, each with their own attributes.
\index{object diagram}
\index{diagram!object}

Finally, Section~\ref{class.diagram} introduces class diagrams,
which show the classes that make up a program and the relationships
between them.
\index{class diagram}
\index{diagram!class}

These diagrams are based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which
is a standardized graphical language used by software engineers
to communicate about program design, especially for object-oriented
programs.
\index{Unified Modeling Language}
\index{UML}

UML is a rich language with many kinds of diagrams that represent
many kinds of relationship between objects and classes.  What I presented
in this book is a small subset of the language, but it is the subset
most commonly used in practice.

The purpose of this appendix is to review the diagrams presented in
the previous chapters, and to introduce Lumpy.  Lumpy, which stands
for ``UML in Python,'' with some of the letters rearranged, is part of
Swampy, which you already installed if you worked on the case study in
Chapter~\ref{turtlechap} or Chapter~\ref{tkinter}, or if you did
Exercise~\ref{canvas},
\index{Lumpy}
\index{Swampy}

Lumpy uses Python's {\tt inspect} module to examine the state of a running
program and generate object diagrams (including stack diagrams) and
class diagrams.

\section{State diagram}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/lumpydemo1.pdf}}
\caption{State diagram generated by Lumpy.}
\label{fig.lumpy1}
\end{figure}

Here's an example that uses Lumpy to generate a state diagram.
\index{state diagram} \index{diagram!state}

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.Lumpy import Lumpy

lumpy = Lumpy()
lumpy.make_reference()

message = 'And now for something completely different'
n = 17
pi = 3.1415926535897932

lumpy.object_diagram()
\end{verbatim}

The first line imports the Lumpy class from {\tt swampy.Lumpy}.
If you don't have Swampy installed as a package, make sure
the Swampy files are in Python's search path and use this
{\tt import} statement instead:

\begin{verbatim}
from Lumpy import Lumpy
\end{verbatim}

The next lines create a {\tt Lumpy} object and make a ``reference''
point, which means that Lumpy records the objects that have been
defined so far.

Next we define new variables and invoke \verb"object_diagram",
which draws the objects that have been defined since the reference
point, in this case {\tt message}, {\tt n} and {\tt pi}.

Figure~\ref{fig.lumpy1} shows the result.  The graphical style is
different from what I showed earlier; for example, each
reference is represented by a circle next to the variable name and a
line to the value.  And long strings are truncated.  But the
information conveyed by the diagram is the same.

The variable names are in a frame labeled \verb"<module>", which
indicates that these are module-level variables, also known as
global.
\index{global variable}
\index{variable!global}
\index{module-level variable}
\index{variable!module-level}

You can download this example from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/lumpy_demo1.py}.  Try adding some
additional assignments and see what the diagram looks like.


\section{Stack diagram}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/lumpydemo2.pdf}}
\caption{Stack diagram.}
\label{fig.lumpy2}
\end{figure}

Here's an example that uses Lumpy to generate a stack diagram.
You can download it from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/lumpy_demo2.py}.
\index{stack diagram} \index{diagram!stack}

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.Lumpy import Lumpy

def countdown(n):
    if n <= 0:
        print 'Blastoff!'
        lumpy.object_diagram()
    else:
        print n
        countdown(n-1)

lumpy = Lumpy()
lumpy.make_reference()
countdown(3)
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig.lumpy2} shows the result.  Each frame is represented
with a box that has the function's name outside and variables inside.
Since this function is recursive, there is one frame for each
level of recursion.
\index{recursion}
\index{function frame}
\index{frame}

Remember that a stack diagram shows the state of the program at
a particular point in its execution.  To get the diagram you want,
sometimes you have to think about where to invoke \verb"object_diagram".

In this case I invoke \verb"object_diagram" after executing the base
case of the recursion; that way the stack diagram shows each level of
the recursion.  You can call \verb"object_diagram" more than once to
get a series of snapshots of the program's execution.
\index{base case}


\section{Object diagrams}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/lumpydemo3.pdf}}
\caption{Object diagram.}
\label{fig.lumpy3}
\end{figure}

This example generates an object diagram showing the lists from
Section~\ref{sequence}.  You can download it from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/lumpy_demo3.py}.
\index{object diagram} \index{diagram!object}

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.Lumpy import Lumpy

lumpy = Lumpy()
lumpy.make_reference()

cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
numbers = [17, 123]
empty = []

lumpy.object_diagram()
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig.lumpy3} shows the result.  Lists are represented by
a box that shows the indices mapping to the elements.  This representation
is slightly misleading, since indices are not actually
part of the list, but I think they make the diagram easier to
read.  The empty list is represented by an empty box. 
\index{list index}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/lumpydemo4.pdf}}
\caption{Object diagram.}
\label{fig.lumpy4}
\end{figure}

And here's an example 
showing the dictionaries from Section~\ref{invert}.  You can download
it from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/lumpy_demo4.py}.
\index{dictionary}

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.Lumpy import Lumpy

lumpy = Lumpy()
lumpy.make_reference()

hist = histogram('parrot')
inverse = invert_dict(hist)

lumpy.object_diagram()
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig.lumpy4} shows the result.  {\tt hist} is a dictionary
that maps from characters (single-letter strings) to integers;
{\tt inverse} maps from integers to lists of strings.

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/lumpydemo5.pdf}}
\caption{Object diagram.}
\label{fig.lumpy5}
\end{figure}

This example generates an object diagram for Point and Rectangle
objects, as in Section~\ref{copying}.  You can download it from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/lumpy_demo5.py}.
\index{Point class}
\index{class!Point}
\index{Rectangle class}
\index{class!Rectangle}

\begin{verbatim}
import copy
from swampy.Lumpy import Lumpy

lumpy = Lumpy()
lumpy.make_reference()

box = Rectangle()
box.width = 100.0
box.height = 200.0
box.corner = Point()
box.corner.x = 0.0
box.corner.y = 0.0

box2 = copy.copy(box)

lumpy.object_diagram()
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig.lumpy5} shows the result.  {\tt copy.copy} make a
shallow copy, so {\tt box} and {\tt box2} have their own {\tt width}
and {\tt height}, but they share the same embedded Point object.  This
kind of sharing is usually fine with immutable objects, but with
mutable types, it is highly error-prone.
\index{copy}
\index{shallow copy}

\section{Function and class objects}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/lumpydemo6.pdf}}
\caption{Object diagram.}
\label{fig.lumpy6}
\end{figure}

When I use Lumpy to make object diagrams, I usually define the functions
and classes before I make the reference point.  That way, function
and class objects don't appear in the diagram.
\index{function object}
\index{object!function}
\index{class object}
\index{object!class}

But if you are passing functions and classes as parameters, you might
want them to appear.  This example shows what that looks like;
you can download it from
\url{http://thinkpython.com/code/lumpy_demo6.py}.

\begin{verbatim}
import copy
from swampy.Lumpy import Lumpy

lumpy = Lumpy()
lumpy.make_reference()

class Point(object):
    """Represents a point in 2-D space."""

class Rectangle(object):
    """Represents a rectangle."""

def instantiate(constructor):
    """Instantiates a new object."""
    obj = constructor()
    lumpy.object_diagram()
    return obj

point = instantiate(Point)
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig.lumpy6} shows the result.  Since we invoke
\verb"object_diagram" inside a function, we get a stack diagram
with a frame for the module-level variables and for the invocation
of {\tt instantiate}.

At the module level, {\tt Point} and {\tt Rectangle} refer to
class objects (which have type {\tt type}); {\tt instantiate}
refers to a function object.
\index{instantiate}
\index{constructor}

This diagram might clarify two points of common confusion: (1) the
difference between the class object, {\tt Point}, and the instance of
Point, {\tt obj}, and (2) the difference between the function object
created when {\tt instantiate} is defined, and the frame created with
it is called.


\section{Class Diagrams}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/lumpydemo7.pdf}}
\caption{Class diagram.}
\label{fig.lumpy7}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centerline
{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figs/lumpydemo8.pdf}}
\caption{Class diagram.}
\label{fig.lumpy8}
\end{figure}

Although I distinguish between state diagrams, stack diagrams and
object diagrams, they are mostly the same thing: they show the
state of a running program at a point in time.
\index{class diagram}
\index{diagram!class}

Class diagrams are different.  They show the classes that make up a
program and the relationships between them.  They are timeless in the
sense that they describe the program as a whole, not any particular
point in time.  For example, if an instance of Class A generally
contains a reference to an instance of Class B, we say there is a
``HAS-A relationship'' between those classes.
\index{HAS-A relationship}
\index{class diagram}
\index{diagram!class}
\index{UML}

Here's an example that shows a HAS-A relationship.  You can download
it from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/lumpy_demo7.py}.

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.Lumpy import Lumpy

lumpy = Lumpy()
lumpy.make_reference()

box = Rectangle()
box.width = 100.0
box.height = 200.0
box.corner = Point()
box.corner.x = 0.0
box.corner.y = 0.0

lumpy.class_diagram()
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig.lumpy7} shows the result.  
Each class is represented with a box that contains the name of the
class, any methods the class provides, any class variables, and
any instance variables.  In this example, {\tt Rectangle} and {\tt Point}
have instance variables, but no methods or class variables.

The arrow from {\tt Rectangle} to {\tt Point} shows that Rectangles
contain an embedded Point.  In addition, {\tt Rectangle} and {\tt
  Point} both inherit from {\tt object}, which is represented in
the diagram with a triangle-headed arrow.
\index{IS-A relationship}

Here's a more complex example using my solution to Exercise~\ref{poker}.
You can download
the code from \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/lumpy_demo8.py};
you will also need \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/PokerHand.py}.

\begin{verbatim}
from swampy.Lumpy import Lumpy

from PokerHand import *

lumpy = Lumpy()
lumpy.make_reference()

deck = Deck()
hand = PokerHand()
deck.move_cards(hand, 7)

lumpy.class_diagram()
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{fig.lumpy8} shows the result.  
{\tt PokerHand} inherits from {\tt Hand}, which inherits from {\tt Deck}.
Both {\tt Deck} and {\tt PokerHand} have Cards.
\index{Card class}
\index{Deck class}
\index{Hand class}

This diagram does not show that {\tt Hand} also has cards, because
in the program there are no instances of Hand.  This example
demonstrates a limitation of Lumpy; it only knows about the
attributes and HAS-A relationships of objects that are instantiated.
