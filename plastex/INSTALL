Installation of plasTeX is very simple.  It installs just like any other
Python package.  Simply run the following command.  Python 2.4+ is required.

    python setup.py install

To generate images for destinations like HTML, you will also need to have
a LaTeX distribution installed, and either ghostscript or, preferably, 
either dvi2bitmap (http://dvi2bitmap.sourceforge.net/) or 
dvipng (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/dvipng/).  You will also
need to install the Python Imaging Library
