The documentation in this directory is available in PDF and HTML format
at http://plastex.sf.net/.  However, if you really want to compile the
documentation yourself, you'll need to add the 'commontex' and 'texinputs'
directories to your TEXINPUTS environment variable as shown below.
These LaTeX style files are the same ones used by the official Python
documentation system.

    # For csh or tcsh users
    setenv TEXINPUTS .:/path/to/plastex/Doc/commontex
    setenv TEXINPUTS ${TEXINPUTS}:/path/to/plastex/Doc/texinputs:

    # For other shell users
    export TEXINPUTS=.:/path/to/plastex/Doc/commontex
    export TEXINPUTS=${TEXINPUTS}:/path/to/plastex/Doc/texinputs:

You should then be able to run pdflatex to get the PDF version of the
documentation.

    pdflatex plastex

Of course to get the index and all the page references correct, you'll
need to run it more than once and also run makeindex to sort the indexes.

    pdflatex plastex
    pdflatex plastex
    makeindex plastex.idx
    pdflatex plastex

If you want to get the HTML version of this documentation, you do not
need to use LaTeX2html as the Python documents say.  plasTeX is capable
of converting this document to HTML using the Python LaTeX styles as
well.  Once you are successful at converting the document to PDF, you
should be able to simply run the following command to generate the 
HTML version.

    plastex plastex
